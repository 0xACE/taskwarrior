Pre-requisites
--------------

You will need the 'cmake' build system installed in order to build taskwarrior
from source.

Optionally, you might want to have Lua installed, if you wish to write plugins
and modify taskwarrior.


Basic Installation
------------------

Briefly, these shell commands will unpack, build and install taskwarrior:

  $ tar xzf task-X.Y.Z.tar.gz                     [1]
  $ cd task-X.Y.Z                                 [2]
  $ cmake .                                       [3]
  $ make                                          [4]
  $ make test                                     [5]
  $ sudo make install                             [6]
  $ cd .. ; rm -r task-X.Y.Z                      [7]

These commands are explained below:

  1. Unpacks the source tarball.  This creates the directory task-X.Y.Z,
     containing all the code.

  2. Change directory to the root of the distribution.

  3. Invokes cmake to scan for dependencies and machine-specific details, then
     generate the makefiles.  This may take a minute.

  4. Builds taskwarrior.  This may take a minute.

  5. Optional step that runs the unit tests.  This will take several minutes,
     during which there will be minimal feedback.  Note that thousands of tests
     are run, and some of those tests need to introduce a delay between commands
     which explains the lengthy time.  On completion, will report the number of
     passing and failing tests.  There should be zero failing tests.

  6. Installs the program, documentation and other data files.

  7. Removes the temporary directory.


Uninstallation
--------------

To uninstall taskwarrior, you need the Makefiles, so if you deleted them in
step 7 above, they must first be regenerated by following steps [1], [2] and
[3].  Then simply run:

    $ sudo make uninstall
