Task 1.5.0 has a custom reports feature.  Three of the existing task reports
are no longer implemented in task, and need to be added as custom reports.
Simply copy the following six lines into your existing .taskrc file.

New task users need not do this - task will create an initial .taskrc file
on first startup.


report.long.columns=id,project,priority,entry,start,due,age,tags,description
report.long.sort=due+,priority-,project+
report.list.columns=id,project,priority,due,active,age,description
report.list.sort=due+,priority-,project+
report.ls.columns=id,project,priority,description
report.ls.sort=priority-,project+
