Thank you for taking a look at task.  Task is a GTD utility featuring:

  - Robust C++ implementation
  - Tags
  - Colorful, tabular output
  - Reports, graphs
  - Lots of commands
  - Low-level API
  - Abbreviations for all commands, options
  - Multi-user file locking
  - Clean architecture allowing quick addition of new features
  - Recurring tasks

It is intended that features, mainly in the form of reports will be added
frequently, with best practices and useful reports evolving from usage patterns.

Task is scope-limited to GTD functionality only.

You may want to watch the old task movie on YouTube:

or the new improved one:

Either will give you a fairly good idea of what task is capable of, and
whether it fits in to your way of working.  As a command line application,
task is not for everyone and some of you may prefer to not proceed.  The
movie or online tutorial file are the quickest way for you to make that
decision.  The online tutorial can be found at:

Task is based on ideas presented in the todo.sh script, found on:

  http://todotxt.org

Task has many more features than todo.sh, but fundamentally, they are
both working toward the same goals, which is to help you follow basic
Getting Things Done (GTD) principles.

All feedback is welcome, in addition to any bug reports or patches to:

  task@beckingham.net

I have found that task makes me more productive and organized.
I hope task can do the same for you.
