Task - a GTD utility featuring:

  - Robust C++ implementation
  - Tags
  - Colorful, tabular output
  - Reports
  - Low-level API
  - Auto-completion on all commands, options
  - Multi-user file locking
  - Clean architecture allowing quick addition of new features
  - UUID for all tasks

Task is an implementation of GTD ideas, similar to todo.sh, but without many of
the limitations in todo.sh, namely:

  - There is no output formatting
  - There is no way to enumerate projects, categories
  - There is no file locking for multi-user access

It is intended that features, mainly in the form of reports will be added
frequently, with best practices and useful reports evolving.

Task is scope-limited to GTD functionality only.
