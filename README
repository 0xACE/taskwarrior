Task is a GTD utility featuring:

  - Robust C++ implementation
  - Tags
  - Colorful, tabular output
  - Reports
  - Low-level API
  - Auto-completion on all commands, options
  - Multi-user file locking
  - Clean architecture allowing quick addition of new features
  - UUID for all tasks

It is intended that features, mainly in the form of reports will be added
frequently, with best practices and useful reports evolving from usage patterns.

Task is scope-limited to GTD functionality only.



Thank you for taking a look at task.

You may want to jump straight to the TUTORIAL file, or perhaps watch the task
movie on YouTube:

Either will give you a fairly good idea of what task is capable of, and whether
it fits in to your way of working.  As a command line application, task is not
for everyone and some of you may prefer to not proceed.  The movie or TUTORIAL
file are the quickest way for you to make that decision.

Task is based on ideas presented in the todo.sh script, found on:

  http://todotxt.org

Task has a few more features than todo.sh, but fundamentally, they are both
working toward the same goals, which is to help you follow basic Getting Things
Done (GTD) principles.

All feedback is welcome, in addition to any bug reports or patches to:
