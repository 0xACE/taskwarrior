                <p>
                  Some task commands require an ID to be specified.  For example:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task 3 done</code></pre>

                <p>
                  This marks a single task as done.  But if you wanted to mark
                  several tasks as done, you could use:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task 3,4,5 done</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Which would mark tasks 3, 4 and 5 as all done.  In this example,
                  the three IDs are consecutive, which means you could also have
                  entered:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task 3-5 done</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Or in a more complex example:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task 1,3-5,12 23-25 done</code></pre>

                <p>
                  This would mark tasks 1, 3, 4, 5, 12, 23, 24 and 25 as done.
                  Note that this example uses two sequences, separated by a space.
                </p>

                <p>
                  You must be careful though.  Task tries very carefully to do
                  the right thing when it interprets the command line, but must
                  still impose some rules so that it can unambiguously read the
                  command.  If you use one or more sequences, then they must
                  appear on the command line adjacent to each other.  If they
                  are separated by something else, then task assumes the second
                  and subsequent set is not a sequence.  Here is an example
                  of this:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task 3 Order part number 4-123</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Clearly the 4-123 is a part number, and not a sequence.
                  Task is being asked to modify the description of task 3 to be
                  "Order part number 4-123".  Note that the ID is separated
                  from the part number by something other than a sequence.
                  Here is a bad example that task will misinterpret:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task 3 4-123 is back-ordered, try again next week</code></pre>

                <p>
                  The intent here is that task 3 have its description modified to be
                  "4-123 is back-ordered, try again next week", but will be
                  misinterpreted as tasks 3, 4, 5, 6 ... 123 will all be modified
                  to have the description "is back-ordered, try again next week".
                  The solution is to quote the whole description:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task 3 "4-123 is back-ordered, try again next week"</code></pre>
