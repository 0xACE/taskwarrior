                <p>
                  Let us begin by adding some tasks:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task add Book plane ticket
% task add Rent a tux
% task add Reserve a rental car
% task add Reserve a hotel room</code></pre>

                <p>
                  That's it.  You'll notice immediately that task has a very
                  minimalist interface.  Let us take a look at those tasks:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task ls

ID Project Pri Description
 1             Book plane ticket
 2             Rent a tux
 3             Reserve a rental car
 4             Send John a birthday card</code></pre>

                <p>
                  The 'ls' command provides the most minimal list of tasks.  Each
                  task has been given an id number, and you can see that there are no
                  projects or priorities assigned.  Wait a minute - I own a tux, I
                  don't need to rent one.  Let us delete task 2:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task 2 delete
Permanently delete task? (y/n) y</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Task wants you to confirm deletions.  To remove the confirmation,
                  edit your .taskrc file and change the line:
                </p>

                <pre><code>confirmation=yes</code></pre>

                <p>
                  to have a value of "no".
                </p>

                <p>
                  While the use of projects and priorities are not essential to
                  benefitting from task, they can be very useful when the list of
                  tasks grows large.  Let's assign a project to these tasks:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task 1 project:Wedding
% task 3 project:Wedding
% task 4 project:Family
% task ls

  ID Project Pri Description
   3 Family      Send John a birthday card
   2 Wedding     Reserve a rental car
   1 Wedding     Book plane ticket</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Notice that the id numbers have changed.  When tasks get deleted,
                  or have their attributes changed (project, for example), the ids are
                  prone to change.  But the id numbers will remain valid until the
                  next 'ls' command is run.  You should only use the ids from the most
                  recent 'ls' command.  The ids change, because task is always trying
                  to use small numbers so that it is easy for you to enter them
                  correctly.  Now that projects are assigned, we can look at just the
                  Wedding project tasks:
                </p>

                <p>
                  Subprojects are supported.  If you have a project "Wedding", you can
                  specify that a task is a subproject "Transport" of "Wedding" by
                  assigning the project "Wedding.Transport".  Let's do this:
               </p>

               <pre><code>% task 2 project:Wedding.Transport
% task ls

ID Project           Pri Description
 3 Family                Send John a birthday card
 2 Wedding.Transport     Reserve a rental car
 1 Wedding               Book plane ticket</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Task matches the leftmost part of the project when searching, so
                  projects may be abbreviated:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task ls project:Wedding.Tra

ID Project           Pri Description
 2 Wedding.Transport     Reserve a rental car</code></pre>

                <p>
                  This way of matching projects can be used to see all tasks under
                  the "Wedding" project and all subprojects:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task ls project:Wedding

ID Project           Pri Description
 2 Wedding.Transport     Reserve a rental car
 1 Wedding               Book plane ticket</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Let's reassign 2 back to the "Wedding" project:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task 2 project:Wedding</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Now that projects are assigned, we can look at just the
                  Wedding project tasks:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task ls project:Wedding

ID Project Pri Description
 1 Wedding     Book plane ticket
 2 Wedding     Reserve a rental car</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Any command arguments after the 'ls' are used for filtering the
                  output.  We could also have requested:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task ls ticket plane

ID Project Pri Description
 1 Wedding     Book plane ticket</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Now let's prioritize.  Priorities can be H, M or L (High, Medium,
                  Low).
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task ls

ID Project Pri Description
 3 Family      Send John a birthday card
 2 Wedding     Reserve a rental car
 1 Wedding     Book plane ticket

% task 1 priority:H
% task 2 prior:M
% task 3 pr:H
Ambiguous attribute 'pr' - could be either of project, priority
% task 3 pri:H
% task ls

ID Project Pri Description
 3 Family  H   Send John a birthday card
 1 Wedding H   Book plane ticket
 2 Wedding M   Reserve a rental car</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Notice that task supports the abbreviation of words such as
                  priority, project.  Priority can be abbreviated to pri, but not pr,
                  because it is ambiguous.  Now that tasks have been prioritized, you
                  can see that the tasks are being sorted by priority, with the
                  highest priority tasks at the top.
                </p>

                <p>
                  These attributes can all be provided when the task is added, instead
                  of applying them afterwards, as shown.  The following command shows
                  how to set all the attributes at once:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task add project:Wedding priority:H Book plane ticket<code></pre>

                <p>
                  The 'ls' command provides the least information for each task.  The
                  'list' command provides more:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task list

ID Project Pri Due Active Age    Description

                <p>
                  Notice that a task can have a due date, and can be active.  The
                  task lists are sorted by due date, then priority.  Let's add due
                  dates:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task 3 due:6/25/2008

                <p>
                  If today's date is 6/23/2008, then task 3 is due in 2 days.  It will
                  be colored yellow if your terminal supports color.  To change this
                  color, edit your .taskrc file, and change the line to one of these
                  alternatives:
                </p>

                <pre><code>color.due=red
color.due=on_blue
color.due=red on_blue
color.due=bold_red on_blue</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Where color is one of the following:
                </p>

                <pre><code>black
blue
red
green
cyan
magenta
yellow
white</code></pre>

                <p>
                  All colors are specified in this way.  Take a look in .taskrc for
                  all the other color rules that you control.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Tagging tasks is a good way to group them, aside from specifying a
                  project.  To add a tag to a task:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task &lt;id&gt; +tag<code></pre>

                <p>
                  The plus sign indicates that this is a tag.  Any number of tags may
                  be applied to a task, and then used for searching.  Tags are just
                  single words that are labels.
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task list
