                  Here are the other commands, in some detail.
                </p>

                <strong>% task</strong>
                <p>
                  With no arguments, this command will generate a help message that
                  lists all these commands.
                </p>

                <strong>% task projects</strong>
                <p>
                  This report generates a list of all the different projects that you
                  are using along with a count of the pending tasks for each project.
                  For example:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task projects

Project   Tasks
Errands       1
Birthdays     3
Car           2</code></pre>


                <strong>% task summary</strong>
                <p>
                  This report lists all the projects and a summary of their task
                  status.
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task summary

Project  Remaining Avg age Complete 0%                        100%

Birthdays        3  7 mths       0%
Car              2   2 wks      25% XXXXXXXXX</code></pre>

                <p>
                  This shows the project, the remaining tasks, the average age of each
                  task, the percentage completed (remaining vs total) and a bar
                  indicating that percentage.
                </p>

                <strong>% task delete &lt;id&gt;</strong>
                <p>
                  There are two ways of getting rid of tasks - mark them as done, or
                  delete them.
                </p>

                <strong>% task undelete &lt;id&gt;</strong>
                <p>
                  If a task was inadvertently deleted, it may be undeleted, provided that no
                  reports have been run since the deletion.  Ideally, the undelete command is
                  run immediately after the erroneous delete command.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If a report is run (such as "task list"), then task performs a garbage
                  collection that removes deleted tasks, and the task cannot be undeleted.
                </p>

                <strong>% task done &lt;id&gt;</strong>
                <p>
                  This is how a task is marked as done.
                </p>

                <strong>% task list ...</strong>
                <p>
                  The list report will show the active status, and age of the task in
                  addition to the columns that "task ls" shows.  It is just a more
                  detailed list.
                </p>

                <strong>% task long ...</strong>
                <p>
                  The long report will show the entry date and start date of a task,
                  in addition to the columns that the "task list" shows.
                </p>

                <strong>% task start &lt;id&gt;</strong>
                <p>
                  This marks a task as started (and therefore active), which is shown
                  in the "list" report:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task list

% task list

...</code></pre>

                <strong>% task active</strong>
                <p>
                  Shows all active tasks, that is, the tasks for which the
                  "task start ..." command was run, as shown above.
                </p>

                <strong>% task overdue</strong>
                <p>
                  Simply lists all the task that have a due date that is past, in
                  "list" format.
                </p>

                <strong>% task history</strong>
                <p>
                  This report shows you an overview of how many tasks were added,
                  completed and deleted, by month.  It looks like this:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task history

Year Month     Added Completed Deleted Net
2008 March        21        16       0   5
     April        13        11       1   1
     May           8        14       3  -9</code></pre>

                <p>
                  This shows that for the three months that task has been used, March
                  and April saw the total number of tasks increase, but in May the
                  number decreased as more task were completed than added.
                </p>

                <strong>% task calendar</strong>
                <p>
                  This report shows a calendar of the current month, with any task
                  due or overdue dates marked on it.  Color is used to mark these
                  dates.
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task calendar

                <strong>% task next</strong>
                <p>
                  This report shows you the tasks you should probable work on next.
                  Task will scan all the tasks and will pick two task from each
                  project to report.  Those two tasks will be chosen in order of
                  overdue, due soon, High, Medium or Low priority.  Essentially task
                  chooses the two most important task for each project and displays
                  them ordered in the usual way.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If you wish to show a different number of tasks per project, modify
                  the entry in .taskrc:
                </p>

                <pre><code>next=2</code></pre>

                <p>
                  To be your preferred number.
                </p>

                <strong>% task &lt;id&gt; ...</strong>
                <p>
                  When a task id is specified, everything applies to just that task.
                  Suppose we needed to correct a task:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task ls

ID Project Pri Description
12 Errand  L   Remember to deposit chekc
...

% task 12 Remember to deposit bonus check
% task ls

ID Project Pri Description
12 Errand  L   Remember to deposit bonus check
...</code></pre>

                <strong>% task oldest</strong>
                <p>
                  Lists the oldest tasks.  Shows 10 tasks by default, but can be
                  set via the "oldest" configuration variable.
                </p>

                <strong>% task newest</strong>
                <p>
                  Lists the newest tasks.  Shows 10 tasks by default, but can be
                  set via the "newest" configuration variable.
                </p>

                <strong>% task /from/to/</strong>
                <p>
                  If a task has been entered with a typo, it can be easily corrected
                  by this command.  For example:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task ls

ID Project Pri Description
12 Errand  L   Remember to deposit chekc
...

% task 12 /chekc/check/
% task ls

ID Project Pri Description
12 Errand  L   Remember to deposit check
...</code></pre>

                <p>
                  This command makes single corrections to a task description.
                </p>

                <strong>% task tags</strong>
                <p>
                  This command will generate a list of all the tags that are currently
                  in use by task.
                </p>

                <strong>% task info &lt;id&gt;</strong>
                <p>
                  This command gives detailed information about a single task.  It
                  will tell you when the task was entered, when started, its status,
                  tags, and more.
                </p>

                <strong>% task stats</strong>
                <p>
                  This command generates a list of statistics about your task usage,
                  such as the average time it takes to complete a task, how often new
                  tasks are added, and more.
                </p>

                <strong>% task completed</strong>
                <p>
                  This generates a list of all tasks that have been completed, sorted
                  by their completion date.
                </p>

                <strong>% task export &lt;file name&gt;</strong>
                <p>
                  This instructs task to write out a CSV format dump of all tasks,
                  both pending and completed, to the file specified.  This is how you
                  might view tasks in a spreadsheet.
                </p>

                <strong>% task colors</strong>
                <p>
                  This command displays all the colors that task supports.
                </p>

                <strong>% task usage</strong>
                <p>
                  If logging has been enabled by the "command.logging=on" directive
                  in the .taskrc file, then task will record every command that is
                  run.  When this command is run, task will display a count of how
                  many times each command was used.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This command is for the purpose of seeing whether command are
                  actually used.
                </p>

                <strong>% task version</strong>
                <p>
                  This can be used to show the version number of task, and to display
                  all the current configuration settings, as read from the .taskrc
                  file.
                </p>

                <strong>% task rc:&lt;file&gt; ...</strong>
                <p>
                  By specifying rc:<file>, it is possible to force task to use an alternate
                  .taskrc file.  By default, task looks in your home directory, so these two
                  commands are essentially identical:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task list
% task rc:~/.taskrc list</code></pre>

                <p>
                  What this override allows, is the possibility of keeping your task lists
                  completely separate, say for work and home.  This can be accomplished with
                  the following commands (valid for bash):
                </p>

                <pre><code>% alias htask="task rc:/home/me/.taskrc_home"
% alias wtask="task rc:/home/me/.taskrc_work"
% htask list
...
% wtask list
...</code></pre>

                <strong>% task &lt;id&gt; fg:... bg:...</strong>
                <p>
                  Not strictly a command, the setting of the fg and bg (foreground
                  and background) attributes determines the colors used to represent
                  the task.  Valid foreground colors are:
                </p>

                <pre><code>         bold          underline          bold_underline
black    bold_black    underline_black    bold_underline_black
red      bold_red      underline_red      bold_underline_red
green    bold_green    underline_green    bold_underline_green
yellow   bold_yellow   underline_yellow   bold_underline_yellow
blue     bold_blue     underline_blue     bold_underline_blue
magenta  bold_magenta  underline_magenta  bold_underline_magenta
cyan     bold_cyan     underline_cyan     bold_underline_cyan
white    bold_white    underline_white    bold_underline_white</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Note that these are not just colors, but combinations of colors and
                  attributes.  Valid background colors are:
                </p>

                <pre><code>on_black    on_bright_black
on_red      on_bright_red
on_green    on_bright_green
on_yellow   on_bright_yellow
on_blue     on_bright_blue
on_magenta  on_bright_magenta
on_cyan     on_bright_cyan
on_white    on_bright_white</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Note also that this capability does depend on whether your terminal
                  program can display these colors.
