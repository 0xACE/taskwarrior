                    Q: When I redirect the output of task to a file, I lose all
                       the colors.  How do I fix this?
                  </b>
                  <br />
                  A: Task knows (or thinks it knows) when the output is not going
                     directly to a terminal, and strips out all the color control
                     characters.  Prevent this with the following entry in your
                     .taskrc file:
                  <pre><code>_forcecolor=on</code></pre>
                </p>

                    Q: How do I backup my task data files?  Where are they?
                  </b>
                  <br />
                  A: Task writes all pending tasks to the file ~/.task/pending.data
                     and all completed and deleted tasks to ~/.task/completed.data.
                     They are text files, so they can just be copied to another
                     location for safekeeping. Don't forget there is also the
                     ~/.taskrc file that contains your task configuration data.
                     <br />
                     <br />
                     To be sure, and to future-proof your backup, consider backing
                     up all the files in the ~/.task directory, because upcoming
                     releases will make greater use of this directory.

                    Q: How can I separate my work tasks from my home tasks?
                       Specifically, can I keep them completely separate?
                  </b>
                  <br />
                  A: You can do this by creating an alternate .taskrc file,
                     then using shell aliases.  Here is are example Bash
                     commands to achieve this:

                  <pre><code>% cp ~/.taskrc ~/.taskrc_home
% (now edit .taskrc_home to change the value of data.location)
% alias wtask="task"
% alias htask="task rc:~/.taskrc_home"</code></pre>

                  This gives you two commands, 'wtask' and 'htask' that
                  operate using two different sets of task data files.
                </p>

                    Q: Can I revert to a previous version of task?  How?
                  </b>
                  <br />
                  A: Yes, you can revert to a previous version of task,
                     simply by <a href="download.html">downloading</a> the
                     prior version and installing it.  If you find a bug in
                     task, then this may be the only way to work around the bug,
                     until a new release is made.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Note that it is possible that the task file format will
                  change.  For example, the format changed between versions
                  1.5.0 and 1.6.0.  Task will automatically upgrade the file
                  but if you need to revert to a previous version of task,
                  there is the file format to consider.  This is yet another
                  good reason to back up your task data files!

                    Q: I'm using Ubuntu 9.04, and I want task to word-wrap
                    descriptions.  How do I do this?
                  </b>
                  <br />
                  A: You need to install ncurses, by doing this:
                  <code><pre>% sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev</pre></code>
                  Then you need to rebuild task from scratch, starting with
                  <code><pre>% cd task-X.X.X
% ./configure
...</pre></code>
                  The result should be a task program that knows the width
                  of the terminal window, and wraps accordingly.

                    Q: How do I build task under Cygwin?
                  </b>
                  <br />
                  A: Task is built the same way everywhere.  But under Cygwin, you'll
                     need to make sure you have the following packages available
                     first:

                     <ul>
                       <li>gcc
                       <li>make
                       <li>libncurses-devel
                       <li>libncurses8
                     </ul>

                     The gcc and make packages allow you to compile the code, and
                     are therefore required, but the ncurses packages are optional.
                     Ncurses will allow task to determine the width of the window, and
                     therefore use the whole width and wrap text accordingly, for a
                     more aesthetically pleasing display.

                    Q: Do colors work under Cygwin?
                  </b>
                  <br />
                  A: They do, but only in a limited way.  You can use regular
                     foreground colors (black, red, green ...) and you can
                     regular background colors (on_black, on_red, on_green ...),
                     but underline and bold are not supported.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                     If you run the command:
                     <code><pre>% task colors</pre></code>
                     Task will display all the colors it can use, and you will
                     see which ones you can use.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                     See the <a href="color.html">color</a> documentation for
                     more details on which colors can be used.

                    Q: How do I use '+word' in a task description, and prevent it
                       from being interpreted as a tag?
                  </b>
                  <br />
                  A: There are several ways to do this.  The simplest is to use
                     the '--' argument in the command line, and task will assume
                     that everything afterwards is part of the description.  For
                     example:
                     <pre><code>% task add -- +tag</code></pre>
                     Allows the task description to be "+tag".  If you use the
                     command:
                     <pre><code>% task &lt;id&gt; edit</code></pre>
                     Then you are free to put (almost) anything in the description
                     field without task interpreting it.
