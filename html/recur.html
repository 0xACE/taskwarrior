              <div class="content">
                <p>
                  Task supports recurring tasks, which is a task that keeps falling due, on a
                  regular schedule.  An example of this may be "pay rent".  Here is how
                  recurring tasks work in task:
                </p>

                <p>
                  Ordinarily, a task is a single item that is entered in the pending state, and
                  remains so until it is either completed or deleted.  This is an example of a
                  single instance task.
                </p>

                <p>
                  A recurring task is different.  When a recurring task is entered, it remains
                  hidden from view, but acts as a root task for a task instances that are
                  generated on a regular basis.  Consider the example:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task Pay rent due:7/1/2008 recur:monthly</code></pre>

                <p>
                  If today's date is 7/10, for example, then that due date is in the past, and
                  you might expect there to be an already overdue task for 7/1/2008, and another
                  due on 8/1/2008.  This means that from that root, task has created two
                  instances with different due dates.
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task list

ID Project Pri Due         Active Age   Description
1              7/1/2008           1 min Pay rent
2              8/1/2008           1 min Pay rent

2 tasks</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Task creates any overdue tasks, then creates one additional due task.  These
                  new task instances are then completed or deleted as you normally would.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In the example above, a new task instance is created every month, and this will
                  repeat indefinitely.  Task also supports an end date.  Suppose you are taking
                  every Friday off work for the summer.  You'll need to submit your TPS report on
                  Thursdays instead:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task TPS report due:thursday recur:weekly until:8/31/2008</code></pre>

                <p>
                  This create a weekly recurring task that expires on 8/31/2008.  What this means
                  is that after all those task instances have been created, then completed or
                  deleted, the root task will expire and disappear.  Task will tell you what it
                  is doing when this happens.
                </p>

                <h4>Deletion</h4>
                <p>
                  When a recurring task is deleted, you will be asked if you would also like to
                  delete all recurring task instances:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task del 1
Permanently delete task? (y/n) y
This is a recurring task.  Do you want to delete all pending
recurrences of this same task? (y/n) y</code></pre>

                <h4>Recurrence Periods</h4>
                <p>
                  In the above examples, the recurrence period was specified as "monthly" and
                  "weekly".  Task supports several ways of specifying this:
                </p>
