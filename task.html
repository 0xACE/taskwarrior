                  Build the task program according to the directions in the INSTALL
                  file.  This transcript illustrates a typical installation:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% ls
task-1.2.0.tar.gz
% gunzip task-1.2.0.tar.gz
% tar xf task-1.2.0.tar
% cd task-1.2.0
% ./configure
...
% make
...
% make install     # (may require sudo, depending on --prefix)</code></pre>

                <p>
                  (For those of you using <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>,
                  you need to make sure you have the "g++" and "make" packages
                  available, which are found in the "devel" category.)
                </p>

                <p>
                  You need to make sure that the installed task program is in your
                  PATH environment variable.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Task reads a configuration file - called .taskrc in your home
                  directory - and stores pending and completed tasks in in a directory
                  specified in the configuration file.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The simplest way to get a configuration file and task directory is
                  to run task.  On startup, task will check to see if it can find the
                  configuration file and task directory, and if not found, will ask
                  you whether it may create both.
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task version

A configuration file could not be found in /Users/paul/.taskrc

Would you like a sample .taskrc created, so task can proceed? (y/n) y
Done.

[then task will show version information]</code></pre>
              </div>

              <br />
              <h2 class="title"><a name="simple">Simple Usage</a></h2>
              <div class="content">
                <p>
                  Let us begin by adding some tasks:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task add Book plane ticket
% task add Rent a tux
% task add Reserve a rental car
% task add Reserve a hotel room</code></pre>

                <p>
                  That's it.  You'll notice immediately that task has a very
                  minimalist interface.  Let us take a look at those tasks:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task ls

ID Project Pri Description
 1             Book plane ticket
 2             Rent a tux
 3             Reserve a rental car
 4             Send John a birthday card</code></pre>

                <p>
                  The 'ls' command provides the most minimal list of tasks.  Each
                  task has been given an id number, and you can see that there are no
                  projects or priorities assigned.  Wait a minute - I own a tux, I
                  don't need to rent one.  Let us delete task 2:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task 2 delete
Permanently delete task? (y/n) y</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Task wants you to confirm deletions.  To remove the confirmation,
                  edit your .taskrc file and change the line:
                </p>

                <pre><code>confirmation=yes</code></pre>

                <p>
                  to have a value of "no".
                </p>

                <p>
                  While the use of projects and priorities are not essential to
                  benefitting from task, they can be very useful when the list of
                  tasks grows large.  Let's assign a project to these tasks:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task 1 project:Wedding
% task 3 project:Wedding
% task 4 project:Family
% task ls

  ID Project Pri Description
   3 Family      Send John a birthday card
   2 Wedding     Reserve a rental car
   1 Wedding     Book plane ticket</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Notice that the id numbers have changed.  When tasks get deleted,
                  or have their attributes changed (project, for example), the ids are
                  prone to change.  But the id numbers will remain valid until the
                  next 'ls' command is run.  You should only use the ids from the most
                  recent 'ls' command.  The ids change, because task is always trying
                  to use small numbers so that it is easy for you to enter them
                  correctly.  Now that projects are assigned, we can look at just the
                  Wedding project tasks:
                </p>

                <p>
                  Subprojects are supported.  If you have a project "Wedding", you can
                  specify that a task is a subproject "Transport" of "Wedding" by
                  assigning the project "Wedding.Transport".  Let's do this:
               </p>

               <pre><code>% task 2 project:Wedding.Transport
% task ls

ID Project           Pri Description
 3 Family                Send John a birthday card
 2 Wedding.Transport     Reserve a rental car
 1 Wedding               Book plane ticket</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Task matches the leftmost part of the project when searching, so
                  projects may be abbreviated:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task ls project:Wedding.Tra

ID Project           Pri Description
 2 Wedding.Transport     Reserve a rental car</code></pre>

                <p>
                  This way of matching projects can be used to see all tasks under
                  the "Wedding" project and all subprojects:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task ls project:Wedding

ID Project           Pri Description
 2 Wedding.Transport     Reserve a rental car
 1 Wedding               Book plane ticket</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Let's reassign 2 back to the "Wedding" project:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task 2 project:Wedding</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Now that projects are assigned, we can look at just the
                  Wedding project tasks:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task ls project:Wedding

ID Project Pri Description
 1 Wedding     Book plane ticket
 2 Wedding     Reserve a rental car</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Any command arguments after the 'ls' are used for filtering the
                  output.  We could also have requested:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task ls ticket plane

ID Project Pri Description
 1 Wedding     Book plane ticket</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Now let's prioritize.  Priorities can be H, M or L (High, Medium,
                  Low).
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task ls

ID Project Pri Description
 3 Family      Send John a birthday card
 2 Wedding     Reserve a rental car
 1 Wedding     Book plane ticket

% task 1 priority:H
% task 2 prior:M
% task 3 pr:H
Ambiguous attribute 'pr' - could be either of project, priority
% task 3 pri:H
% task ls

ID Project Pri Description
 3 Family  H   Send John a birthday card
 1 Wedding H   Book plane ticket
 2 Wedding M   Reserve a rental car</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Notice that task supports the abbreviation of words such as
                  priority, project.  Priority can be abbreviated to pri, but not pr,
                  because it is ambiguous.  Now that tasks have been prioritized, you
                  can see that the tasks are being sorted by priority, with the
                  highest priority tasks at the top.
                </p>

                <p>
                  These attributes can all be provided when the task is added, instead
                  of applying them afterwards, as shown.  The following command shows
                  how to set all the attributes at once:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task add project:Wedding priority:H Book plane ticket<code></pre>

                <p>
                  The 'ls' command provides the least information for each task.  The
                  'list' command provides more:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task list

                  Notice that a task can have a due date, and can be active.  The

                  color, edit your .taskrc file, and change the line to one of these

                <pre><code>black

red
green
cyan
magenta
yellow
white</code></pre>

                <p>
                  All colors are specified in this way.  Take a look in .taskrc for
                  all the other color rules that you control.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Tagging tasks is a good way to group them, aside from specifying a
                  project.  To add a tag to a task:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task &lt;id&gt; +tag<code></pre>

                <p>
                  The plus sign indicates that this is a tag.  Any number of tags may
                  be applied to a task, and then used for searching.  Tags are just
                  single words that are labels.
                </p>

                <strong>% task projects</strong>
                <p>
                  This report generates a list of all the different projects that you
                  are using along with a count of the pending tasks for each project.
                  For example:

                <p>
                  This shows the project, the remaining tasks, the average age of each
                  task, the percentage completed (remaining vs total) and a bar
                  indicating that percentage.

                <strong>% task delete &lt;id&gt;</strong>
                <p>
                  There are two ways of getting rid of tasks - mark them as done, or
                  delete them.
                </p>

                <strong>% task done &lt;id&gt;</strong>
                <p>
                  This is how a task is marked as done.
                </p>

                <strong>% task list ...</strong>
                <p>
                  The list report will show the active status, and age of the task in
                  addition to the columns that "task ls" shows.  It is just a more
                  detailed list.
                </p>

                <strong>% task long ...</strong>
                <p>
                  The long report will show the entry date and start date of a task,
                  in addition to the columns that the "task list" shows.
                </p>

                <strong>% task start &lt;id&gt;</strong>
                <p>
                  This marks a task as started (and therefore active), which is shown
                  in the "list" report:

                  Shows all active tasks, that is, the tasks for which the
                  "task start ..." command was run, as shown above.
                </p>

                <strong>% task overdue</strong>
                <p>

                  This shows that for the three months that task has been used, March
                  and April saw the total number of tasks increase, but in May the
                  number decreased as more task were completed than added.

                <strong>% task next</strong>
                <p>
                  This report shows you the tasks you should probable work on next.
                  Task will scan all the tasks and will pick two task from each
                  project to report.  Those two tasks will be chosen in order of
                  overdue, due soon, High, Medium or Low priority.  Essentially task
                  chooses the two most important task for each project and displays
                  them ordered in the usual way.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If you wish to show a different number of tasks per project, modify
                  the entry in .taskrc:
                </p>

                <pre><code>next=2</code></pre>

                <p>
                  To be your preferred number.
                </p>

                <strong>% task &lt;id&gt; ...</strong>
                <p>
                  When a task id is specified, everything applies to just that task.
                  Suppose we needed to correct a task:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task ls

ID Project Pri Description

...</code></pre>

                <strong>% task /from/to/</strong>
                <p>
                  If a task has been entered with a typo, it can be easily corrected
                  by this command.  For example:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task ls

ID Project Pri Description
12 Errand  L   Remember to deposit chekc
...

% task 12 /chekc/check/
% task ls

ID Project Pri Description
12 Errand  L   Remember to deposit check
...</code></pre>

                <p>
                  This command makes single corrections to a task description.
                </p>

                <strong>% task tags</strong>
                <p>
                  This command will generate a list of all the tags that are currently
                  in use by task.
                </p>

                <strong>% task info &lt;id&gt;</strong>
                <p>
                  This command gives detailed information about a single task.  It
                  will tell you when the task was entered, when started, its status,
                  tags, and more.
                </p>

                <strong>% task stats</strong>
                <p>
                  This command generates a list of statistics about your task usage,
                  such as the average time it takes to complete a task, how often new
                  tasks are added, and more.
                </p>

                <strong>% task completed</strong>
                <p>
                  This generates a list of all tasks that have been completed, sorted
                  by their completion date.
                </p>

                <strong>% task export &lt;file name&gt;</strong>
                <p>
                  This instructs task to write out a CSV format dump of all tasks,
                  both pending and completed, to the file specified.  This is how you
                  might view tasks in a spreadsheet.
                </p>

                <strong>% task colors</strong>
                <p>
                  This command displays all the colors that task supports.
                </p>

                <strong>% task usage</strong>
                <p>
                  If logging has been enabled by the "command.logging=on" directive
                  in the .taskrc file, then task will record every command that is
                  run.  When this command is run, task will display a count of how
                  many times each command was used.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This command is for the purpose of seeing whether command are
                  actually used.
                </p>

                <strong>% task version</strong>
                <p>
                  This can be used to show the version number of task, and to display
                  all the current configuration settings, as read from the .taskrc
                  file.
                </p>

              <br />
              <h2 class="title"><a name="shell">Interacting with the Shell</a></h2>
              <div class="content">
                <p>
                  Certain characters are interpreted by the shell.  For example, the
                  "&amp;".  If you wish to include the &amp; in a task description,
                  you need to escape it, so the shell doesn't interpret it.  For
                  example:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task add Buy bread &amp; milk</code></pre>

                <p>
                  This command is an error because of the &amp;.  The shell will
                  consider this to be two commands:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task add Buy bread &amp;
% milk</code></pre>

                <p>
                  The shell treats the &amp; character as an indicator that the
                  command is complete and should be run in the background.  Then the
                  shell considers "milk" to be a command all by itself.  Which it is
                  not.  One way to get around this is to individually escape the &amp;
                  character:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task add Buy bread \&amp; milk</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Another is to quote the entire description, with either ' or "
                  characters:
                </p>

                <pre><code>% task add "Buy bread &amp; milk"</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Task itself interprets the commands, and it too can make mistakes.
                  For example, any colon : character will be interpreted by task as a
                  delimiter between an attribute name and its value.  Currently there
                  is no workaround for this.
                </p>

                <strong>% task &lt;id&gt; fg:... bg:...</strong>
                <p>
                  Not strictly a command, the setting of the fg and bg (foreground
                  and background) attributes determines the colors used to represent
                  the task.  Valid foreground colors are:
                </p>

                <pre><code>         bold          underline          bold_underline
black    bold_black    underline_black    bold_underline_black
red      bold_red      underline_red      bold_underline_red
green    bold_green    underline_green    bold_underline_green
yellow   bold_yellow   underline_yellow   bold_underline_yellow
blue     bold_blue     underline_blue     bold_underline_blue
magenta  bold_magenta  underline_magenta  bold_underline_magenta
cyan     bold_cyan     underline_cyan     bold_underline_cyan
white    bold_white    underline_white    bold_underline_white</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Note that these are not just colors, but combinations of colors and
                  attributes.  Valid background colors are:
                </p>

                <pre><code>on_black    on_bright_black
on_red      on_bright_red

on_white    on_bright_white</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Note also that this capability does depend on whether your terminal
                  program can display these colors.

                <dd>
                  May be "on" or "off", defaulting to "off".  This determines

                   when a task is completed that is not considered high priority.
                   The "task next" command lists important tasks, and completing
                   one of those does not generate this nagging.  Default value is:

                   <strong>Note: try to stick to high priority tasks.  See "task next".</strong>
                </dd>

                <dt>next</dt>
                <dd>
                  Is a number, defaulting to 2, which is the number of tasks for
                  each project that are shown in the "task next" command.
                </dd>

                <dt>curses</dt>
                <dd>
                  Determines whether task uses ncurses to establish the size of
                  the window you are using, for text wrapping.
                </dd>

                <dt>blanklines</dt>
                <dd>
                  May be "on" or "off".  Prevents the display of unnecessary blank
                  lines so that task makes better use screen real estate on small-
                  screened devices.
                </dd>

                    This is a string of characters that define how task formats dates.
                    The default value is:
                  </p>

                  <pre><code>m/d/Y</code></pre>

                  <p>
                    which means dates look like:

                  be one optional foreground color (see below) and one optional
                  background color.  For example, the value may be:
                  <br />

ID is the numeric identifier displayed by the 'task list' command

Tags are arbitrary words, any quantity:
  +tag               The + means add the tag
  -tag               The - means remove the tag

Attributes are:
  project:           Project name
  priority:          Priority
  due:               Due date
  fg:                Foreground color
  bg:                Background color

Any command or attribute name may be abbreviated if still unique:
  task list project:Home
  task li       pro:Home

Some task descriptions need to be escaped because of the shell:
  task add "quoted ' quote"
  task add escaped \' quote

Many characters have special meaning to the shell, including:
  $ ! ' " ( ) ; \ ` * ? { } [ ] < > | &amp; % # ~</code></pre>
