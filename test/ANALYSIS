* project.t
FH Failed test 'project with spaces'

* text.t
PB need to use a UTF-8 friendly way of doing input[--eol].

* merge.duplicate.t
FH merge ignores URI then outputs wrong (???) msg ?????

* delete.t
FH 'task info' shows tasks from the completed.data file when doing a filter on the ID
   could it be confused and interpretes this as an UUID
