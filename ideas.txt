Real Parsing
  define grammar for command line
  implement flex/bison parser
  new grammar includes:
    - task delete <ID> [<ID> ...]
    - task done <ID> [<ID> ...]

User-Defined Reports
  report.large=id,uuid,project,priority,entry,start,due,active,tags,description
  report.long=id,project,priority,entry,start,due,tags,description
  report.list=id,project,priority,due,active,description
  report.ls=id,project,priority,description

  Sorting is always: due+ priority- project+

  ID UUID Project Priority Entry Start Due Active Tags Description

Test Suite
  - allow .taskrc override
  - debug=on to cause all cout to be csv
  - regression tests for every bug, command, feature

Recurrence
  + new T::status recurring (stored as R)
  + new user-specifiable attributes - recur:<duration> [until:<date>]
  + duration:
      daily, day, 1d
      Nd
      weekly, 1w
      Nw
      biweekly
      monthly, 1m
      bimonthly
      Nm
      quarterly, 1q
      Nq
      biannual, biyearly
      annual, yearly, 1y
      Na, Ny
  + recur: without due:   => Error
  + until: without recur: => Error
  + New file format:  supports status R, recur:, until:, base:, range:
  - on TDB.gc, adjust base: and compress range: for T::status == recurring
  - all recurring tasks are removed from lists by T::*pendingT, and a synthetic
    addendum is generated
  - when a recurring task is completed, range: is updated, and a synthetic
    task is added to completed.data that retains the attributes of the root

  - Scenario:
      # Today = 6/22/2008
      % task add Friday due:6/15/2008 recur:weekly until 8/1/2008
        # task must generate a base and range
        # base:6/15/2008
        # range:-------
        #       ^6/15
        #        ^6/22
        #         ^6/29
        #          ^7/6
        #           ^7/13
        #            ^7/20
        #             ^7/27
      % task ls
      1 Friday 6/15/2008 .lte. today     (overdue)
      2 Friday 6/22/2008 .lte. today     (due)
