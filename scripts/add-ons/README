External Scripts
----------------

Add-on scripts are executed via an alias mechanism in taskwarrior.  This has the
effect of this command:

    task <script> <arguments>

resulting in the ultimate execution of:

    <script> <arguments>

All external scripts are treated in the same manner, and have no access to the
taskwarrior internals.
