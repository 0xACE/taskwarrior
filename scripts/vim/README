The task data files (pending.data and completed.data) as well as edits made
via commands like "task 1 edit" can be color-highlighted if you happen to use
VIM as your preferred text editor.  For this to work, you need to first have
syntax highlighting enabled when you use VIM.  This happens to be the default
for most VIM installations, but it is usually quite simple if that doesn't
happen to be so in your case.  Rather than repeat the excellent VIM
documentation here, please see the appropriate VIM documentation itself.
Generally this can be made seen by starting vim/gvim and issuing the following
command:

    :help syntax

You may prefer to use your web browser via:

    http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/syntax.html#syntax


Once you have VIM's syntax highlighting enabled and working with other file
types properly, configuring it for use with task is simple.  Just extract
these files into your home directory so that you have:

~/.vim/ftdetect/task.vim
~/.vim/syntax/taskdata.vim
~/.vim/syntax/taskedit.vim


You should then be ready to go.
