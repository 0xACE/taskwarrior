How to Build Taskwarrior

  Satisfy the Requirements:
    - gcc 4.4 or later, clang 2.9 or later or equivalent. This is because 2.4.1
      marks the first step towards using modern C++11. Initially this involves
      only feature N1984.
    - libuuid
    - gnutls (optional)

  Obtain and build code:
    $ git clone https://git.tasktools.org/scm/tm/task.git task.git
    $ cd task.git
    $ git checkout 2.4.2                 # Latest dev branch
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug .   # debug or release. Default: neither.
    $ make VERBOSE=1                     # Shows details

  Running Test Suite:
    $ cd tests
    $ make VERBOSE=1                     # Shows details
    $ ./run_all                          # Runs all tests silently > all.log
                                         # Install 'vramsteg' for blinkenlights
    $ ./problems                         # Enumerate test failures in all.log

  Note that any development should be performed using a git clone, and the
  current development branch. The source tarballs do not reflect HEAD, and do
  not contain the test suite.

  If you send a patch (support@taskwarrior.org), make sure that patch is made
  against git HEAD on the development branch. We cannot apply patches made
  against the tarball source, or master.

General Statement
  This file is intended to convey the current efforts, priorities and needs of
  the codebase. It is for anyone looking for a way to start contributing.
  While this is biased towards developers, anyone can contribute, and everyone
  is encouraged to do so. Here are many ways to contribute that may not be
  immediately obvious to you:

  - Use Taskwarrior, become familiar with it, and make suggestions. There are
    always ongoing discussions about new features and changes to existing
    features.

  - Join us in the #taskwarrior IRC channel on freenode.net. Many great ideas,
    suggestions, testing and discussions have taken place there. It is also
    the quickest way to get help, or confirm a bug.

  - Join https://answers.tasktools.org and help us by asking, answering and
    voting on questions and answers, directly helping those who ask, and
    helping future users who search for existing answers.

  - Review documentation: there are man pages, online articles, tutorials and
    so on, and these may contain errors, or they may not convey ideas in the
    best way. Perhaps you can help improve it. Contact us - documentation is
    a separate effort from the codebase, and includes all web sites, and all
    are available using git.

  - Take a look at the bug database, and help triage the bug list. This is a
    review process that involves confirming bugs, providing additional data,
    information or analysis. Bug triage is very useful and much needed. You
    could check to see that an old bug is still relevant - sometimes they are
    not.

  - Review the source code, and point out inefficiencies, problems, unreadable
    functions, bugs and assumptions.

  - Fix a bug. For this you'll need C++ and Git skills, but this is one of
    the largest ways you can contribute. We welcome all bug fixes, provided
    the work is done well and doesn't create other problems or introduce new
    dependencies. We recommend talking to us before starting. Seriously.

  - Add unit tests. Unit tests are possibly the most useful contributions of
    all, because they not only improve the quality of the code, but prevent
    future regressions, therefore maintaining quality of subsequent releases.
    Plus, broken tests are a great motivator for us to fix the causal defect.
    You'll need Python skills, as we are migrating from Perl to Python for our
    test suite.

  - Add a feature. Well, let's be very clear about this: adding a feature is
    not usually well-received, and if you add a feature and send a patch, it
    will most likely be rejected. The reason for this is that there are many
    efforts under way, in various code branches. There is a very good chance
    that the feature you add is either already in progress, or being done in a
    way that is more fitting when considering other work in progress. So if
    you want to add a feature, please don't. Start by talking to us, and find
    out what is currently under way or planned. You might find that we've
    already rejected such a feature for some very good reasons. So please
    check first, so we don't duplicate effort or waste anyone's time.

  - Donate some server time to the testing effort, by participating in the
    continuous integration of all changes, with our Flod software. See this
    page for an example:  http://central.tasktools.org. Ask us about running a
    Flod satellite, we're always looking for exotic platforms to test on.

  - Spread the word. Help others become more effective at managing tasks.

  - Encouragement. Tell us what works for you, and what doesn't. Tell us about
    your methodology for managing tasks. It's all good.

  - Request a feature. This not only tells us that you think something is
    missing from the software, but gives us insights into how you use it.
    Plus, you might get your feature implemented.

  Next are some specific areas that need attention.

Deprecated Code
  This is code that is going to be phased out soon, and therefore is not worth
  fixing or documenting. Don't waste your time.

  - Priorities in core. This will be migrated to become a UDA as soon as we
    have the right support in place for custom sorting.

  - Nag feature.

  - Attribute modifiers.

New Code Needs
  This is code that needs to be written.

  - Need export_viz.* script. Any language. This would have value as an example
    or template script serving as a starting-point for anyone who needed this
    format.
  - Need new export_xxx.* scripts - the more the better. Any language.
  - The JSON.{h,cpp} code is fast and efficient up to a point, but has a non-
    linear performance curve, implying a slowdown due to fragmentation, but who
    know? Find it, fix it.
  - Need an external script that can locate and correct duplicate UUIDs in the
    data file, as found by 'task diag'. This should check to see if there is
    a suitable UUID generator installed. This should also be careful to
    properly handle recurring tasks.
  - Take a look at:

      https://bug.tasktools.org/browse/EX

    This 'extension' release is a collection of all the requested features that
    lie outside of the core product, and will be implemented as external scripts
    by anyone who wishes to participate.

Unit Tests Needed
  There are always more unit tests needed. More specifically, better unit tests
  are always needed. The convention is that there are four types of unit test:

  1. High level tests that exercise large features, or combinations of commands.
     For example, dependencies.t runs through a long list of commands that test
     dependencies, but do so by using 'add', 'modify', 'done' and 'delete'.
  2. Regression tests that ensure certain bugs are fixed and stay fixed. These
     tests are named bug.NNN.t where NNN refers to the Redmine issue number.
     While it is not worth creating tests for small fixes like typos, it is for
     changes to the logic.
  3. Small feature tests. When small features are added, we would like small,
     low-level feature tests named feature.NNN.t, where NNN is the Redmine
     issue number.
  4. Code tests. These are tests written in C++ that exercise C++ objects, or
     function calls. These are the lowest level tests. It is important that
     these kind of tests be extensive and thorough, because the software depends
     on this code the most.

  The tests are mainly written in Perl, and all use TAP. We want them all to be
  eventually replaced by Python, so we are now only accepting new tests that use
  the Python-based approach you can see in some of the existing tests.

  Tests needed:

  - Take a look at the bug database (https://bug.tasktools.org) and notice that
    many issues, open and closed, have the "needsTest" label. These are things
    that we would like to see in the test suite, as regression tests.
  - The basic.t unit tests are a misnomer, and should be either removed or
    renamed. We have long talked of 'basic functionality' that includes add,
    delete, done, and list commands. We need unit tests that prove that basic
    functionality is working, and the file containing them should be called
    basic.t.
  - Test propagation of modifications to recurring tasks.
  - Test regex support.
  - Need unit tests for each bug in the issue list that is marked with the
    'needsTest' label.

  Note that running the unit tests currently requires the Perl JSON module to
  be installed.

  Note that all new unit tests should follow the test/template.t standard.

Work in Progress

  Things that are currently in flux, which is another way of saying leave it
  alone while it is being worked on.

  - All columns/Col*::validate methods.
  - New columns/Col*::modify methods.
