This file is intended to convey the current efforts, priorities and needs of the
codebase.  It is for developers looking for a way to start contributing.


Deprecated Code
  This is code that is going to be phased out soon, and therefore is not worth
  fixing or documenting.  Don't waste your time.

  - Variant.{h,cpp}
  - Location.{h,cpp}
  - TDB.{h,cpp}
  - Att.{h,cpp}

New Code Needs
  This is code that needs to be written, usually down at the C++ function level.

  - text.cpp extractLines needs to be rewritten in a UTF8-aware and color-code
    sensitive manner.
  - Need a function to accept a list of projects, and return an indented list
    that reflects the hierarchy.  This will likely go into the new 'projects'
    command.  Something like:
      Input  - "one"
               "one.two"
               "one.two.three"
               "one.four"
               "two"
      Output - "one"
               "  one.two"
               "    one.two.three"
               "  one.four"
               "two"
  - Take all the Config::checkXXX methods and create a new legacy.cpp file
    that handles dealing with all legacy checks.  To be called from
    src/commands/CmdShow.cpp.
  - Need export_sql.yy script.  Any language.
  - Need export_viz.yy script.  Any language.
  - Need new export_xxx.yy scripts - the more the better.  Any language.
  - The JSON.{h,cpp} code is fast and efficient up to a point, but has a non-
    linear performance curve, implying a slowdown due to fragmentation.  Fix it.
    Test rig and sample data available on request.
  - Devise a complete rule set for Task::validate.  What should it warn about?
  - Need a function that can optimize color codes.  For example, if a string
    contains this:
      <red>one two </red><red>three four</red>
    It can be shortened to:
      <red>one two three four</red>
    This is only possible if there is nothing between </red> and <red> and the
    colors match.

Documentation Needed
  Various forms of documentation that are needed, or are in need of review or
  update.

  - Wiki/How-To: Date Handling
  - Wiki/How-To: Urgency Customization
  - Wiki/How-To: Custom Reports, including performance considerations
  - Wiki/How-To: Aliases, particularly new enhanced aliases
  - Wiki: Export formats

Holiday Data Needed
  We are moving the holiday data to http://holidata.net, and providing a
  script that can automatically update taskwarrior holiday files from the
  web.  This allows us to provide corrections and additional data without
  the need for a corresponding taskwarrior release.

  If you can provide regional holiday data, we would be very grateful, and
  ideally it could go up on holidata.net for everyone to share.

Unit Tests Needed
  There are always more unit tests needed.

  - The basic.t unit tests are a misnomer, and should be either removed or
    renamed.  We have long talked of 'basic functionality' that includes add,
    delete, done, and list commands.  We need unit tests that prove that basic
    functionality is working, and it should be called basic.t.
  - None of the current unit tests remove the new backlog.data file, and they
    all should.
  - None of the current unit tests remove the 'extensions' directory, and they
    all should.
  - Need tests of command line expressions.
  - Test propagation of modifications to recurring tasks.
  - Test regex support.
  - Need unit tests for each bug in the issue list, if suitable.

Work in Progress
  Things that are currently in flux, which is another way of saying leave it
  alone while it is being worked on.

  - The A3.{h,cpp} and E9.{h,cpp} (Args and Expression) objects are being
    completd and tested.
  - L10N (Localization) is in progress.  This means moving all user-presented
    strings into en-US.h, which is included by i18n.h.  Language selection will
    be a cmake-controlled #define.  This is 86% complete.  This makes
    translation possible, but there is no active project to make this happen.
    It is expected that translation files will trickle in, and create a
    maintenance burden.  We don't know how we're going to deal with this yet.
    They will probably be downloadable files.

Current Codebase Condition

  'master' branch:
    - 1.9.4 release, current, locked.

  '2.0.0' branch:
    - Unit tests passing >85%.
    - Basic commands working (add, list, done), otherwise generally broken.
    - Expressions E9.{h,cpp} not working.
    - DOM access DOM.{h,cpp} not working well.
    - Aiming for an early August beta1.
    - Aiming for a late August beta2.
    - Aiming for a release in 2011, probably September, but when it is ready.
