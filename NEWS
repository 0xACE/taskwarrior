New Features in taskwarrior 2.0.0

  - New 'ids' command that returns a filtered set of task ID numbers, instead
    of the actual tasks.  For advanced pipeline use.
  - Now supplements the command line with data read from standard input, which
    allows commands like:  echo 'add Pay the bills' | task
  - Attribute modifiers may be prefixed with '~' to return the opposite of a
    filter's results.
  - Status attribute can now be used in report.
  - Project names may now contain spaces.
  - New export-html.pl script.
  - Now supports the 'inverse' color attribute.
  - Reports may now be sorted by columns that are not displayed (example: ID,
    project, due date and description sorted by urgency).
  - Performance enhancements.
  - New 'next' report, that gauges urgency and reports the most urgent tasks.
  - Fine control of verbosity through the 'verbose=' configuration variable.
  - New 'execute' command that runs external scripts/programs.
  - JSON is the new default export format.
  - New 'reports' command that lists reports and their descriptions.
  - New complex aliases.
  - Filtering now available on most read-only commands.
  - The done, delete, start and stop commands now allow modification to the
    task and annotations.
  - New 'columns' command to list the supported columns and formats.

  Please refer to the ChangeLog file for full details.  There are too many to
  list here.
