New commands in taskwarrior 1.9.4

  - 'burndown.daily', 'burndown.weekly', 'burndown.monthly', also with
    'burndown' that is an alias to burndown.weekly.
  - 'count' accepts a filter, and simply returns a count of the tasks
    matching the filter.  Used as a helper command by scripts.

New configuration options in taskwarrior 1.9.4

  - color.burndown.pending, color.burndown.started and color.burndown.done
    control the color of the burndown charts.
  - burndown.bias, which is a tweakable control for the completion estimation
    for the burndown charts, and is documented in taskrc(5).
  - defaultwidth=0 is causes word-wrapping to be turned off, and effectively
    set reports to potentially have infinite width .
  - regex=on enables regular expression searches for filters (task list a...e
    matches 'above') and substitutions (task <id> /a...e/over/ changes 'above'
    to 'over').  Default is off, as this is an advanced feature.
  - journal.info controls whether a change log for each task is displayed by
    the 'info' command.
  - gc=off can be used, temporarily, to defer GC until later commands, which
    eliminates problems with task ID numbers for script writers.
  - calendar.offset=off and calendar.offset.value=-1 to apply an offset value
    to change the effective first month in the calendar report.
