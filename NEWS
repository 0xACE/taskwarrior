Newly Deprecated Features in Taskwarrior 2.5.2

  - The 'DUETODAY' virtual tag is a synonym for the 'TODAY' virtual tag, and is
    not needed.
  - The 'new-uuid' verbosity option is to be removed due to being redundant, its
    functionality will be merged with 'new-id' option.
  - The use of alternate Boolean configuration settings is deprecated. Use values
    "0" for off, and "1" for on.  Avoid used of "on", "off", "true", "t",
    "false", "f", "yes", "y", "no", "n".

Removed Features in 2.5.2

  - There is no longer a 16-color default configuration for some platforms,
    making all platforms 256-color.
