New configuration options in taskwarrior 2.3.0

  - 'taskd.server' specifies host:port of the Taskserver.
  - 'taskd.credentials' specifies user credentials for the Taskserver.
  - 'taskd.certificate' specifies the Taskserver certificate for authentication.
  - 'taskd.key' specifies the Taskserver key for encryption.
  - 'taskd.ca' specifies the Taskserver CA.
  - 'taskd.trust' overrides certificate checking.
  - 'taskd.ciphers' overrides default cipher selection.

Newly deprecated features in taskwarrior 2.3.0
  
  - File format 2 (used in version 0.9.3 - 1.5.0) is no longer supported.
  - The 'push', 'pull' and 'merge' commands will be removed in a subsequent
    release.  The new 'sync' command, in conjunction with the Taskserver is the
    new sync mechanism.
  - The 'diagnostics' command no longer generates 1000 UUIDs as a uniqueness
    test, because libuuid is now mandatory.

Known Issues

  - There is a zsh bug (fixed, but not necessarily updated in your OS) that can
    cause the terminal to crash when completion is invoked.  See the issue for
