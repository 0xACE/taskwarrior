New Features in taskwarrior 2.2.0

  - Bash autocompletion now works with aliases.
  - Virtual tags provide a tag query interface to more complex states.  See the
    'man task' page for details.
  - Deprecated 'fg' and 'bg' attributes removed.  Any residual use of those will
    appear as orphaned UDAs.
  - Tasks now have a 'modified' attribute, which indicates the last time, if at
    all, that they were modified.
  - Statistics now report total number of blocked and blocking tasks.
  - The 'columns' command now supports search term for the column name.
  - New date shortcuts, 'socm' and 'eocm', meaning start and end of current
    month.
  - Improved error messages for 'push' and 'pull' transport problems.

New commands in taskwarrior 2.2.0

  - New '_aliases' helper command lists aliases for completion purposes.

New configuration options in taskwarrior 2.2.0

  - New color rule 'color.uda.<uda-name>'.
  - Added the configuration variable 'print.empty.columns', which defaults to
    'no'.  This allows more efficient use of horizontal space.
  - Any ~ characters in a default .taskrc file are preserved.

Newly deprecated features in taskwarrior 2.2.0
  
  - The bash completion script no longer expands IDs after 'depends:'.
    (Such expansion required running gc() which is not correct.)
  - The incomplete support for Lua extensions was removed.
