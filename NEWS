Welcome to Task 1.0.0.

While Task has undergone much testing, bugs are sure to remain.  If you
encounter a bug, please contact me at bugs@beckingham.net.  Here is what you
could do, in order of increasing effort (to you) and usefulness (to me):

  - Do nothing.  Bug probably won't get fixed.

  - Send an email to bugs@beckingham.net, explaining what you saw.  The bug
    will be addressed, and a new release will be made.  You will be a hero.

  - Send an email, and a reproducible test case in the form of the few commands
    it takes to recreate the problem.  The bug will be addressed, and a new
    release will be made.  You will be a hero.

  - If you are a developer, send a patch that fixes the problem.  Your patch
    will be applied and tested, and a new release will be made.  You will be a
    hero.

Thank you.
