New Features in Taskwarrior 2.4.5

  - The active context, if one is set, is now identified in "task context list"
  - It is an error to attempt and add or remove of a virtual tag.

New commands in Taskwarrior 2.4.5

  - The '_unique' command shows a set of unique values for the specified
    attribute

New configuration options in Taskwarrior 2.4.5

Newly deprecated features in Taskwarrior 2.4.5

  - The '_ids', '_projects', '_tags', '_uuids' helper commands are deprecated,
    and replaced by the new '_unique' helper command.

Removed features in 2.4.5

  - The script 'context' was removed, now that context is a core feature.
  - NonÂ­extended forms of ISO-8601 date/time support is removed. This means
    that 'YYYYMMDD' is no longer supported, but 'YYYY-MM-DD' is. For times,
    'hhmmss' is no longer supported, but 'hh:mm:ss' is. The non-enxtended
    forms all contain sequences of digits that make the identification of
    IDs, UUIDs, and various date/time formats problematic.
