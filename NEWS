Welcome to Task 1.6.1.

Task has been built and tested on the following configurations:

  - OS X 10.4 Tiger
  - OS X 10.5 Leopard
  - Fedora Core 8
  - Fedora Core 9
  - Fedora Core 10
  - Ubuntu 7 Feisty Fawn
  - Ubuntu 8 Hardy Heron
  - Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid Ibex
  - Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope
  - Solaris 10
  - Cygwin 1.5.25-14

While Task has undergone testing, bugs are sure to remain.  If you encounter a
bug, please contact me at task@beckingham.net.  Here is what you could do, in
order of increasing effort (to you) and usefulness (to me):

  - Do nothing.  Bug probably won't get fixed.

  - Send an email to task@beckingham.net, explaining what you saw.  The bug
    will be addressed, and a new release will be made.  You will be a hero.

  - Send an email, and a reproducible test case in the form of the few commands
    it takes to recreate the problem.  The bug will be addressed, and a new
    release will be made.  You will be a hero.

  - If you are a developer, send a patch that fixes the problem.  Your patch
    will be applied and tested, and a new release will be made.  You will be a
    hero.

Thank you.
