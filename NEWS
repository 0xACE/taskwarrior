    will be addressed, and a new release will be made.  You will be a hero.

  - Send an email, and a reproducible test case in the form of the few commands
    it takes to recreate the problem.  The bug will be addressed, and a new
    release will be made.  You will be a hero.

  - If you are a developer, send a patch that fixes the problem.  Your patch
