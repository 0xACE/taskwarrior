New Features in Taskwarrior 2.4.5

  - The active context, if one is set, is now identified in "task context list"
  - It is an error to attempt adding or removing a virtual tag.
  - New 'UDA', 'ORPHAN', 'PROJECT', 'PRIORITY' and 'LATEST'  virtual tags.

New commands in Taskwarrior 2.4.5

  - The '_unique' command shows a set of unique values for the specified
    attribute
  - The 'commands' command shows the supported commands, with additional
    details that determine some of their behavior.

New configuration options in Taskwarrior 2.4.5

  - The 'json.depends.array' setting controls whether dependencies are exported
    as a JSON array, of a comma-separated string.  Default is 'on'.
    Both variations are imported.
  - The 'color.uda.<name>.none' is a color that is applieѕ to tasks that do
    not have a value for the UDA '<name>'.
  - A Cygwin fix means that now we can default 'search.case.sensitive' to 'yes',
    and all platforms are again equal.
  - The new 'recur' verbosity token generates a message when a recurring task is
    generated.
  - The new 'unwait' verbosity token generates a message when a waiting task
    becomes visible.

Newly deprecated features in Taskwarrior 2.4.5

  - The '_ids', '_projects', '_tags', '_uuids' helper commands are deprecated,
    and replaced by the new '_unique' helper command.
  - Comma-separated ID lists are deprecated.

Removed features in 2.4.5

  - The script 'context' was removed, now that context is a core feature.
  - Non­extended forms of ISO-8601 date/time support is removed. This means
    that 'YYYYMMDD' is no longer supported, but 'YYYY-MM-DD' is. For times,
    'hhmmss' is no longer supported, but 'hh:mm:ss' is. The non-enxtended
    forms all contain sequences of digits that make the identification of
    IDs, UUIDs, and various date/time formats ambiguous.
  - Comma-separated UUID lists are no longer supported.
  - DOM references may no longer be abbreviated.
