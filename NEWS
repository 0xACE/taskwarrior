New configuration options in taskwarrior 2.3.0

  - 'taskd.server' specifies host:port of the task server.
  - 'taskd.credentials' specifies user credentials for the task server.
  - 'taskd.certificate' specifies the task server certificate.
  - 'debug.tls' shows TLS log information, for debugging.

Newly deprecated features in taskwarrior 2.3.0
  
  - File format 2 (used in version 0.9.3 - 1.5.0) is no longer supported.
  - The 'push', 'pull' and 'merge' commands will be removed in a subsequent
    release.  The new 'sync' command, in conjunction with the Task Server is the
    new sync mechanism.
  - The 'diagnostics' command no longer generates 1000 UUIDs as a uniqueness
