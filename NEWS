New Features in task 1.9.3

  - Start and stop times for a task can now be recorded as annotations.
  - Special tags 'nocolor', 'nocal' and 'nonag'.
  - Now supports durations in dates, such as:
      $ task ... due:4d
      $ task ... due:3wks
  - Now supports the beginning of the week, month and year in dates.
  - Now supports 'now' as a date.
  - Now defines an overdue task as being one second after the due date,
    instead of the day after the due date.

  Please refer to the ChangeLog file for full details.  There are too many to
  list here.

New commands in task 1.9.3

  - New 'task color legend' command will show samples of all the defined colors
    and color rules from your .taskrc and theme.

New configuration options in task 1.9.3

  - journal.time, journal.time.start.annotation, journal.time.stop.annotation
  - 'sow', 'som' and 'soy' are now accepted in dates
    'soww' and 'eoww' are now synonyms for 'sow' and 'eow' (ww = working week)
    'socw' and 'eocw' refer to the calendar week (starting Sunday/Monday and
    ending Saturday/Sunday)

Newly deprecated features in task 1.9.3

  - entry_time, start_time and end_time are now synonyms for the entry, start
    and end fields.  Recent enhancements to date formatting render these fields
    obsolete.  The 'task show' command warns of the use of these deprecated
    fields.  The synonyms will be removed in a future version of task.
