                                         Hello.  This is a demonstration of the
                                         taskwarrior color capabilities coming
                                         in version 1.9.

task color                               The color command shows the various
                                         supported colors.  For this you will
                                         need an xterm with 256-color support,
                                         or an equivalent.

                                         This demo uses iTerm running on Snow
                                         Leopard.
