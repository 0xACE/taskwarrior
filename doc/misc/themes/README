Themes

To generate samples of themes, first execute the 'run' script to generate the
sample data.  Note that this data may need to be tweaked to include qualities
that need to be illustrated in theme sample.

Then edit the 'rc' file to include the desired theme file.

Then run 'per' once per theme, and capture the display.

Note that this will require that the terminal window be switched between a black
and white background to properly show the light and dark themes.

Note that for the solarized themes, the terminal color palette needs to be set
to specific colors.
