                                         There are several forms of help available.  We will look at
                                         the various options.

# http//taskwarrior.org                  If you find you have any questions, you can get answers in
                                         several ways.  The website has user forums, issue tracking
                                         and online documentation, including this tutorial.

                                         There is also a command reference PDF that we recommend
                                         you download and use.  It shows all the supported commands
                                         and options at a glance.

# IRC #taskwarrior                       You can join the Taskwarrior IRC channel to pose questions,
                                         or join in the discussion.

# support@taskwarrior.org                Or you can submit your request by email.  The various
                                         support options are all volunteer-run.

task help                                There is a built in help page which summarizes commands,
                                         reports and other details.

man task                                 Finally, you have several man pages installed that contain
                                         all the written documentation, including this tutorial.
                                         The main man page offers syntax and command help.

man taskrc                               The taskrc page describes all the supported configuration
                                         options (and there are many), which you can use to
                                         customize the behavior of taskwarrior.

man task-color                           Use of color, color rules and themes are described in the
                                         task color page.

man task-tutorial                        The tutorial faq is simply an aggregated collection of all
                                         the tutorials.

man task-sync                            This page describes the various sync alternatives, with
                                         examples to help you keep your tasks lists up to date.

                                         If you find a bug, or even suspect you found a bug, please
                                         let us know.  Ideally you would send an email to
                                         support@taskwarrior.org, describe the problem, and include
task diagnostics                         information about your installation.  The 'diagnostics'
                                         command provides the details we might need to diagnose the
                                         problem.
