[Make window 116x32 for movie recording, light text, dark background]

This is the script from which a 2.0-specific movie will be made.  On the left
are the typed commands, and on the right is the voice track.

It is intended that the left and right be combined and the result will be a new
task-tutorial.5 man page.



---------------------------------------- Configuration ---------------------------------------------

task show                                There is a 'show' command, that is used to display the
                                         active configuration.  There are hundreds of settings that
                                         can be changed, and every one has a sensible default.

man taskrc                               If you want a complete list of all the settings and their
                                         meanings, read the man page.

task config answer 42                    The 'config' command is used to modify the settings, and in
                                         this case the configuration variable 'answer' is given the
                                         value of 42.

task show answer                         The 'show' command indicates that the value was changed,
task config answer                       and also that the variable is unrecognized.  The show
                                         command performs a detailed check on your configuration, and
                                         alerts you to several kinds of problem.  The config command
                                         can also remove a value.

task rc.report.list.sort=description+ list
                                         A very powerful feature is the ability to override the
                                         configuration variables temporarily.  Here I am requesting
                                         an ascending sort on the description field only.
