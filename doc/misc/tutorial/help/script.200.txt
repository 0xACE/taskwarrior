[Make window 116x32 for movie recording, light text, dark background]

This is the script from which a 2.0-specific movie will be made.  On the left
are the typed commands, and on the right is the voice track.

It is intended that the left and right be combined and the result will be a new
task-tutorial.5 man page.



---------------------------------------- Help ------------------------------------------------------

task help                                You'll find a quick reference page built in, with the 'help'
man task                                 command, or perhaps you'll want to take a look at the several
man taskrc                               man pages installed.  This demo has superficially shown
man task-color                           many features which have more capability and depth which you
                                         can find in the man pages, and online.

man task-tutorial                        This screencast is actually just a recording of me going
                                         through the tutorial.

man task-faq                             Some frequently asked questions are answered here.

man task-sync                            You've patiently watched this whole movie, so here's your
                                         reward - taskwarrior 1.9.3 has network synchronization
                                         features, for sharing tasks across computers.  But this is
                                         just a teaser - synch will be shown in the next movie.
