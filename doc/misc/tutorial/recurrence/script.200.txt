This is the script from which a 2.0-specific movie will be made.  On the left
are the typed commands, and on the right is the voice track.

It is intended that the left and right be combined and the result will be a new
task-tutorial.5 man page.

                                         To illustrate a point, let's set up a recurring annual task
