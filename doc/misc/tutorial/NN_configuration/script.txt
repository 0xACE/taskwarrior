On the left are the typed commands.  On the right is the audio track.  Where the
left and right are aligned, the audio should match the commands.


---------------------------------------- Configuration ---------------------------------------------

cat ~/.taskrc                            The taskwarrior configuration file is minimal.  This means
                                         it contains only what is needed to override the default
                                         settings.  Initially you see that the config file contains
                                         just one setting which points to your data directory.

task show                                The 'show' command displays all the configuration settings
                                         with their current values.  These are all described in the
                                         taskrc man page.

task show hyph                           You can provide a pattern, to limit the results to only
                                         settings that match the pattern.

task config hypenate off                 The config command is used to modify the configuration,
                                         here we are turning off hyphenation.  Notice that changes
                                         require confirmation.

task show hyph                           Now when we look at the setting, we see that it is now
                                         highlighted to indicate that it not longer has the default
                                         value.

task config hyphenate on                 We can turn that setting back on.

task config hyphenate                    Alternatively we can just remove the setting, and rely on
                                         the default.  This is a better choice because it de-
                                         clutters your configuration file.

task config answer 42                    In this example, we set the configuration variable 'answer'
                                         to have a value of 42.

task show answer                         The 'show' command indicates that the setting is not
                                         recognized.  This could indicate a mistake with the setting
                                         name.  It is harmless to have unrecognized settings, but
                                         also pointless.

task config answer ''                    Specifying an empty value using quotes is how you would
                                         set a blank value without restoring default settings.

task config answer                       In this case, deleting the setting is correct.

                                         ---

task rc.hyphenate=off list               A very powerful feature is the ability to override the
                                         configuration variables temporarily.  Here we are running
                                         the 'list' report with hyphenation temporarily disabled.

task rc.data.location=/other/path list   You can also override the data directory to use a different
                                         task list ...

task rc:~/.other_taskrc list             Or you can override the configuration file completely.

TASKDATA=/other/path task list           The TASKDATA environment variable can also be used to
                                         specify an alternate data directory, and ...

TASKRC=~/.other_taskrc list              The TASKRC variable can override the configuration file.
