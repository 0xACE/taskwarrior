[Make window 116x32 for movie recording, light text, dark background]

This is the script from which a 2.0-specific movie will be made.  On the left
are the typed commands, and on the right is the voice track.

It is intended that the left and right be combined and the result will be a new
task-tutorial.5 man page.



---------------------------------------- Modifications ---------------------------------------------

task 7 Pay rent at the end of the month  Task 7 is not worded correctly, so I can modify that by
                                         specifying a task ID and a new description.  This is also
                                         considered a bulk change, and so requires confirmation.

task add music                           We'll need music.
task 8 prepend Select some               I can prepend to that.
task 8 append for after dinner           I can append to that.
task list

task edit                                I can also go straight into an editor and modify anything.

task add Hire a band?    <---            Sometimes the command will confuse the shell.  In this case,
                                         what would happen if there was a file named 'bands' in the
                                         current directory?  The shell would expand that wildcard,
                                         so to avoid that, you can...
task add Hire a band\?   <---            escape the wildcard...
task add "Hire a band?"  <---            or quote the whole description...

task add -- Hire a band\? +dj            You can also use the minus minus operator which tells
                                         taskwarrior to stop being clever and interpret the rest
                                         of the arguments as a task description.  Otherwise, that
                                         +dj would be interpreted as a tag.

task undo                                We don't need a band, so the easiest way to get rid of that
                                         task is to undo the last change.  Taskwarrior has a
                                         complete undo stack, so you can undo all the way back to
                                         the beginning.
task 1 delete                            The undo operation gets rid of the task completely, but I
task undo                                could also have just deleted the task, then the deletion
                                         itself would be tracked, and also undoable.
