[Make window 116x32 for movie recording, light text, dark background]

This is the script from which a 2.0-specific movie will be made.  On the left
are the typed commands, and on the right is the voice track.

It is intended that the left and right be combined and the result will be a new
task-tutorial.5 man page.



---------------------------------------- Import/Export ---------------------------------------------

task export.csv                          You can export your tasks.  Here you see all tasks being
                                         exported in CSV format.

task export.csv venue                    Let's just export one task in CSV format...
task export.vcalendar venue              Or in VCalendar format...
task export.yaml venue                   Or YAML.

cat file.text                            I can also import.  Here I am importing simple lines of
task import file.text                    text.  Taskwarrior recognizes the format and confirms.

cat file.yaml                            Here is a YAML example.  Taskwarrior can read several
task import file.yaml                    formats, including old versions of its data files.  Using
                                         YAML, you can round-trip the data without loss.

task new limit:2                         Here are the imported tasks.
