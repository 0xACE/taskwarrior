# Hi.                                    Hello, and welcome to Taskwarrior.  This is the first of
                                         many tutorials, and covers first-time use.

                                         As a first-time user, you are going to need a configuration
                                         file and a data directory.  Taskwarrior will create both of
                                         these for you, in your home directory, the first time you
                                         run taskwarrior.

task version                             Answer 'yes' to the question.  After creating the missing
                                         file and directory, you'll see the current version
                                         displayed.

cat ~/.taskrc                            The configuration file contains very little.  This is
                                         because Taskwarrior has a built-in set of sensible defaults
                                         and the configuration file just contains overrides to those
                                         defaults.

ls -l ~/.task                            The task data directory is empty.  That's because we have
                                         added no tasks.  Typically you won't need to look in that
                                         directory.

                                         ---

                                         Let's get started with tasks.  Here is the 30-second
                                         tutorial on basic takwarrior usage.

task add priority:H Pay bills            

                                         Easy. Do you see that second one has a High priority?

task ls                                  Now let's look at those tasks.  They are ordered by
                                         priority. Let's mark number 2 as done:

task 2 done
task ls

                                         Task 2 is now gone.  Now we can delete that remaining task,
                                         because, well, why bother now we are already using task:

task 1 delete
task ls

                                         And that's all you *need* to know.  These four commands
                                         will allow you to use taskwarrior effectively.  If you are
                                         new to taskwarrior, it is recommended that you stop here,
                                         and go manage your task lists.  We don't want you to be
                                         overwhelmed, when what you really need is a way to
                                         organize and get things done.

                                         When you are comfortable with basic taskwarrior usage,
                                         there are many other features you can learn about.  While
                                         you are not expected to learn all of them, or even find
                                         them useful, you might just find exactly what you need.
