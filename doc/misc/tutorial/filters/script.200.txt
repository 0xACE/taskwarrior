[Make window 116x32 for movie recording, light text, dark background]

This is the script from which a 2.0-specific movie will be made.  On the left
are the typed commands, and on the right is the voice track.

It is intended that the left and right be combined and the result will be a new
task-tutorial.5 man page.



---------------------------------------- Advanced Filters ------------------------------------------

task list                                Filters are a very powerful tool.  First here is an
task list invit                          unfiltered list, which shows all tasks.  Now again, but with
                                         the text 'invit', which acts as a filter on the description
                                         field.

task list description.contains:invit     This is the equivalent form using attribute modifiers.  In
                                         this example we are filtering on descriptions that contain
                                         the word fragment.  Here we are using the 'contains'
                                         modifier, but there are many others.

task list desc.word:the                  All tasks containing the whole word 'the'.  See how
                                         annotations are also searched?

task list desc.noword:invitations        Here is a list of all tasks that do not contain the whole
                                         word 'invitations'.

task list pro:party                      Here list all tasks in the 'party' project.
task list pro.is:party                   And the full equivalent.
task list pro.not:party                  Here list tasks that are not in the 'party' project.  I
                                         could have also used 'isnt' here - there are several
                                         synonyms for modifiers, so that the filter can be written
                                         so that it reads naturally.

task list pro:party pri.over:L           Here the 'over' modifier is filtering on priorities that
                                         sort higher than 'Low', and also filtering on the 'party'
                                         project.  There are two terms in this filter.

task list pro:party limit:2              Same again, but only show me the first two tasks.
task list limit:page                     Now all tasks, but just show the first page of tasks.  I
                                         don't have a page full of tasks here, but you get the idea.

task all status:pending                  Now you can see how some of the built-in reports work.  The
                                         'list' report is just all tasks, filtered so that only the
                                         pending tasks are shown.

task all status:waiting                  The 'waiting' report is similarly defined.
