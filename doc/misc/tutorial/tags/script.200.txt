[Make window 116x32 for movie recording, light text, dark background]

This is the script from which a 2.0-specific movie will be made.  On the left
are the typed commands, and on the right is the voice track.

It is intended that the left and right be combined and the result will be a new
task-tutorial.5 man page.



---------------------------------------- Tags ------------------------------------------------------

task list                                A task may only have one project, but it may have any number
                                         of tags, which are just single words associated with the task.

task 3,5,6 +mall                         I can go to the print shop at the mall, and do all the
                                         invitation tasks, so let's tag them all.

task long                                The long report shows tags, too,

task list +mall                          and I can use tags as a filter to any report too.

task 3 -mall                             I made a mistake - I can't mail out the invitations at the
                                         mall, so let's remove that tag.

---------------------------------------- Special Tags ----------------------------------------------

task 6 +nocolor                          You've seen tags, but there are also 'special tags' that
task list                                have effects on individual tasks.  The 'nocolor' special
                                         tag causes the color rules to be bypassed.

task tags                                Special tags are highlighted by the 'tags' command.

task 6 -nocolor                          There are others - the 'nonag' special tag prevents the
                                         generation of nag messages when you work on low priority
                                         tasks when there are more important ones.

                                         The 'nocal' special tag will prevent a task from appearing
                                         on the calendar.
