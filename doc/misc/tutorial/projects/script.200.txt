[Make window 116x32 for movie recording, light text, dark background]

This is the script from which a 2.0-specific movie will be made.  On the left
are the typed commands, and on the right is the voice track.

It is intended that the left and right be combined and the result will be a new
task-tutorial.5 man page.

task add Pay teh rent on teh 31st        Remember to pay the rent at the end of the month.  Oh,
task 7 /teh/teh/g                        that was sloppy, but it can be fixed with a global
task list                                substitution.

task 7 project:home                      We can now use projects to separate home chores from the
                                         party preparation.  Let's assign that last task to the
                                         'home' project.  Note that a task may only belong to one
                                         project.

task 1-6 project:party                   And we will put those first six tasks in the 'party'
                                         project.  See how we specify a range of tasks?  Taskwarrior
                                         will want to confirm bulk changes like this, but we'll
                                         accept all changes here.

task projects                            Now that we have multiple projects, as shown here, we can
task list project:home                   use project as a filter for the list report.  You can see
task li pro:par                          again that we can abbreviate 'list' and 'project', but when
                                         we abbreviate 'party', we are filtering all the projects
                                         that begin with 'par'.
