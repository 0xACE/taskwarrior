[Make window 116x32 for movie recording, light text, dark background]

This is the script from which a 2.0-specific movie will be made.  On the left
are the typed commands, and on the right is the voice track.

It is intended that the left and right be combined and the result will be a new
task-tutorial.5 man page.



---------------------------------------- Custom Report ---------------------------------------------

                                         You can even define your own custom report.  Let's quickly
                                         create a custom report - we'll call it foo - and I can
                                         choose from a long list of fields to include in the report,
                                         but I want to see the ID, the date when I entered the task,
                                         and the description.  I can specify the labels for those
                                         columns, the sort order of the report, and I can filter.

cat >> ~/.taskrc
report.foo.description=My own report
report.foo.columns=id,entry,description
report.foo.labels=ID,Entered,Description
report.foo.sort=entry+,description+
report.foo.filter=status:pending

task help | grep foo                     Custom reports also show up on the help output.

task show report.foo                     I can inspect the configuration.

task foo                                 And they can be run just like the other reports.
