[Make window 116x32 for movie recording, light text, dark background]

This is the script from which a 2.0-specific movie will be made.  On the left
are the typed commands, and on the right is the voice track.

It is intended that the left and right be combined and the result will be a new
task-tutorial.5 man page.



---------------------------------------- Color -----------------------------------------------------

task config color on                     All the examples so far have been shown with color turned
task list                                off.  How about some color?

                                         What you see is the result of a set of color rules being
                                         applied to the tasks.  There is a hierarchy of color rules
                                         that colorize a task based on the metadata

task 1 "bg:on red"                       Here is an example of an explicit override to the color
task list                                rules where a specific task is given a red background.
task 1 bg:                               Note that the quotes are necessary, otherwise the shell
                                         will consider "bg:on" and "red" to be separate arugments.

task color                               Taskwarrior supports 256 colors on certain terminal
                                         emulators, and this shows the range of colors available.

task color white on red                  This is how to show a color sample.

task color legend                        Or samples of all the active color settings.

                                         Themes are a simple way to use coordinated color schemes
                                         so by including a color theme into the configuration file,
                                         you can see some striking effects.

                                         A blue theme.

# include /usr/local/share/doc/task/rc/dark-blue-256.theme
vi ~/.taskrc
task color legend
task list
                                         A red theme.

# include /usr/local/share/doc/task/rc/dark-red-256.theme
vi ~/.taskrc
task color legend
task list
                                         A general dark theme.

# include /usr/local/share/doc/task/rc/dark-256.theme
vi ~/.taskrc
task list

                                         Here is are two color rules that specify a dark blue
                                         background for all tasks that are part of the 'party'
                                         project, and uses bold to identify any tasks with the
                                         keyword 'invitations' in the description.

task "rc.color.project.party=on rgb001" rc.color.keyword.invit=bold list

man task-color                           There is a man page with a writeup of all the color
                                         capabilities.
