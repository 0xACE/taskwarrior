[Make window 116x32 for movie recording, light text, dark background]

This is the script from which a 2.0-specific movie will be made.  On the left
are the typed commands, and on the right is the voice track.

It is intended that the left and right be combined and the result will be a new
task-tutorial.5 man page.



---------------------------------------- Dependencies ----------------------------------------------

task list pro:party                      Taskwarrior supports dependencies.  Let's take a look at the
                                         party planning tasks, and assign dependencies.

task 3 depends:6                         Let's see.  I can't mail invitations until they are printed.
task 6 dep:5                             I can't print them until I design them.
task 2 dep:1                             I need to select a weekend before a location.
task 5 dep:1,2                           Design depends on location and weekend.
task 4 dep:1                             And the caterer needs to know where.

task long pro:party                      All my tasks are blocked except task 1.  That makes sense.

task 5 dep:-1                            Hmm, that double dependency isn't right.

task blocked                             Here are the blocked tasks.
task unblocked                           and the opposite, the unblocked tasks.

task 1 info                              If we look at task 1 closely, we can see that it is blocking
task 2 info                               2 and 4.  And if we look at task 2, we see that it is
                                         blocked by 1, and blocking 5.

                                         This is called a dependency chain, which is a string of tasks
                                         that are all connected not only by their project, but by
                                         dependencies.

                                         Now we understand that task 1 should be done first, but you
                                         may still violate the laws of physics if you wish. Let's
                                         complete task 2 and see what happens.

task 2 done  (y)                         Taskwarrior realizes what you are doing, and offers to fix
task 1 info                              the dependency chain to reflect what you have done.
