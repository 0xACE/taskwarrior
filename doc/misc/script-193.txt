Although currently incomplete, this is the script from which a 1.9.3-specific
movie will be made.  On the left are the typed commands, and on the right is the
spoken track.

It is intended that the left and right be combined and the result will be a new
task-tutorial.5 man page.



---------------------------------------- Intro -----------------------------------------------------

http://taskwarrior.org                   Hello, and welcome to this task version 1.9.3 demo.
                                         I'm going to show you over 100 features, so don't blink, or
                                         you'll miss some.  Even experienced task users are going to
                                         learn something.

                                         I will start off with basic usage, and proceed to more
                                         sophisticated commands as we go along.

---------------------------------------- Basic Usage -----------------------------------------------

                                         Let's get started.  We're planning a party, and there is a
                                         lot of work to do, so let's capture these tasks.
task add Select a good day in August     First decide 'when'.
task add Select and book a venue         Then decide 'where'.
task add Come up with a guest list       Then decide 'who'.
task add Mail invitations                Let's send out nice invitations.
task add Select a caterer                And a caterer.

task list                                Let's take a look.  Good.

task log Order a special cake            Now I've already ordered a cake, so rather than 'add' this,
                                         I'm going to 'log' it.  This just means that I want to keep
                                         track of the task, but I've already done it.  It saves me a
                                         step.

task 4 duplicate /Mail/Design/           As for those invitations, I'm going to need to design them
task 4 dup /Mail/Print/                  first.  And I'm also going to need print them.  Here we are
task list                                duplicating a task and making a substitution.  Notice how
                                         the commands can be abbreviated, provided they are still
                                         unique.

task 3 done                              That looks good - but now I think of it, I already have my
task list                                guest list, so I can mark that one as done.

                                         And that's basic usage, and you already know enough to be
                                         productive using task.  If you stopped here, you would be
                                         perfectly able to manage your task list.

                                         But if you want to see what task can really do, keep watching...

---------------------------------------- Projects --------------------------------------------------

task add Pay teh rent on teh 31st        Remember to pay the rent at the end of the month.  Oh,
task 7 /teh/teh/g                        that was sloppy, but it can be fixed with a global
task list                                substitution.

task 7 project:home                      We can now use projects to separate home chores from the
                                         party preparation.  Let's assign that last task to the
                                         'home' project.  Note that a task may only belong to one
                                         project.

task 1-6 project:party                   And we will put those first six tasks in the 'party'
                                         project.  See how we specify a range of tasks?  Task will
                                         want to confirm bulk changes like this, but we'll accept
                                         all changes here.

task projects                            Now that we have multiple projects, as shown here, we can
task list project:home                   use project as a filter for the list report.  You can see
task li pro:par                          again that we can abbreviate 'list' and 'project', but when
                                         we abbreviate 'party', we are filtering all the projects
                                         that begin with 'par'.

---------------------------------------- Priorities ------------------------------------------------

task 1-3,5 priority:H                    Priorities are another way to organize tasks.  You can use
task list                                priority values of high, medium and low, and task knows
                                         these as H, M or L.

task 3 pri:                              You can remove priorities by specifying a blank value.

---------------------------------------- Tags ------------------------------------------------------

task list                                A task may only have one project, but it may have any number
                                         of tags, which are just single words associated with the task.

task 3,5,6 +mall                         I can go to the print shop at the mall, and do all the
                                         invitation tasks, so let's tag them all.

task long                                The long report shows tags, too,

task list +mall                          and I can use tags as a filter to any report too.

task 3 -mall                             I made a mistake - I can't mail out the invitations at the
                                         mall, so let's remove that tag.

---------------------------------------- Modifications ---------------------------------------------

task 7 Pay rent at the end of the month  Task 7 is not worded correctly, so I can modify that by
                                         specifying a task ID and a new description.  This is also
                                         considered a bulk change, and so requires confirmation.

task add music                           We'll need music.
task 8 prepend Select some               I can prepend to that.
task 8 append for after dinner           I can append to that.
task list

task edit                                I can also go straight into an editor and modify anything.

task add Hire a band?    <---            Sometimes the command will confuse the shell.  In this case,
                                         what would happen if there was a file named 'bands' in the
                                         current directory?  The shell would expand that wildcard,
                                         so to avoid that, you can...
task add Hire a band\?   <---            escape the wildcard...
task add "Hire a band?"  <---            or quote the whole description...

task add -- Hire a band\? +dj            You can also use the minus minus operator which tells task
                                         to stop being clever and interpret the rest of the arguments
                                         as a task description.  Otherwise, that +dj would be
                                         interpreted as a tag.

task undo                                We don't need a band, so the easiest way to get rid of that
                                         task is to undo the last change.  Task has a complete undo
                                         stack, so you can undo all the way back to the beginning.
task 1 delete                            The undo operation gets rid of the task completely, but I
task undo                                could also have just deleted the task, then the deletion
                                         itself would be tracked, and also undoable.

---------------------------------------- Info ------------------------------------------------------

task 1 info                              During that undo operation, task displayed metadata that
                                         is associated with the task.  You can display this with the
task 1                                   info command, and it's shortcut.

task stats                               There are also statistics that task gathers, which I can
                                         display.

---------------------------------------- Annotations -----------------------------------------------

task 1 annotate the 12th looks good      Annotations are little notes that can be added to a task.
task 1 annotate or the 13th              There can be any number, and each has a time stamp.
task list

task 1 denotate 13th                     Annotations can be removed by providing a matching pattern.

---------------------------------------- Configuration ---------------------------------------------

task show                                Task has a 'show' command, that is used to display the
                                         active configuration.  There are hundreds of settings that
                                         can be changed, and every one has a sensible default.

man taskrc                               If you want a complete list of all the settings and their
                                         meanings, read the man page.

task config answer 42                    The 'config' command is used to modify the settings, and in
                                         this case the configuration variable 'answer' is given the
                                         value of 42.

task show answer                         The 'show' command indicates that the value was changed,
task config answer                       and also that the variable is meaningless to task.  The show
                                         command performs a detailed check on your configuration, and
                                         alerts you to several kinds of problem.  The config command
                                         can also remove a value.

task rc.report.list.sort=description+ list
                                         A very powerful feature is the ability to override the
                                         configuration variables temporarily.  Here I am requesting
                                         an ascending sort on the description field only.

---------------------------------------- Defaults --------------------------------------------------

task config default.command list         Task has a default command, which can be set to anything,
task                                     in this case it is set to the 'list' report.  Then running
                                         task with no command name runs the default command.

task config default.priority H           I can also specify a default priority and project, which
task config default.project Work         means that any tasks added will use them, unless an
task add New task                        alternative is provided.
task list

task undo                                Let's just revert those changes, to clean up.
task config default.priority
task config default.project

---------------------------------------- Color -----------------------------------------------------

task config color on                     All the examples so far have been shown with color turned
task list                                off.  How about some color?

                                         What you see is the result of a set of color rules being
                                         applied to the tasks.  There is a hierarchy of color rules
                                         that colorize a task based on the metadata

task 1 "bg:on red"                       Here is an example of an explicit override to the color
task list                                rules where a specific task is given a red background.
task 1 bg:                               Note that the quotes are necessary, otherwise the shell
                                         will consider "bg:on" and "red" to be separate arugments.

task color                               Task supports 256 colors on certain terminal emulators,
                                         and this shows the range of colors available.

task color white on red                  Task can also show a sample of a color.

task color legend                        Or samples of all the active color settings.

                                         Themes are a simple way to use coordinated color schemes
                                         so by including a color theme into the configuration file,
                                         you can see some striking effects.

                                         A blue theme.

vi ~/.taskrc # include /usr/local/share/doc/task/rc/dark-blue-256.theme
task color legend
task list
                                         A red theme.

task list
                                         A general dark theme.

vi ~/.taskrc # include /usr/local/share/doc/task/rc/dark-256.theme
task list

                                         Here is a color rule that specifies a dark blue
                                         background for all tasks that are part of the 'party'
                                         project, and uses bold to identify any tasks with the
                                         keyword 'invitations' in the description.

task rc:x "rc.color.project.party=on rgb001" rc.color.keyword.invit=bold list

man task-color                           There is a man page with a writeup of all the color
                                         capabilities.

                                         You can even define your own custom report.  Let's quickly
                                         create a custom report - we'll call it foo - and I can
                                         choose from a long list of fields to include in the report,
                                         but I want to see the ID, the date when I entered the task,
                                         and the description.  I can specify the labels for those
                                         columns, the sort order of the report, and I can filter.

  cat >> ~/.taskrc
  report.foo.description=My own report
  report.foo.columns=id,entry,description
  report.foo.labels=ID,Entered,Description
  report.foo.sort=entry+,description+
  report.foo.filter=status:pending

  task help | grep foo                   Custom reports also show up on the help output.

  task show report.foo                   You can inspect the configuration.

  task foo                               And they can be run just like the other reports.
