.SH WELCOME
Welcome to the task FAQ.  If you have would like to see a question answered
here, please send us a note at <support@taskwarrior.org>.

.TP
.B Where does task store the data?
By default, task creates a .taskrc file in your home directory and populates it
with defaults.  Task also creates a .task directory in your home directory and
puts data files there.

.TP
.B Can I edit that data?
Of course you can.  It is a simple text file, and looks somewhat like the JSON
format, and if you are careful not to break the format, there is no reason not
to edit it.  But task provides a rich command set to do that manipulation for
you, so it is probably best to leave those files alone.
