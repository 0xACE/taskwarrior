.SH NAME
taskrc \- Configuration file for the task(1) command

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B $HOME/.taskrc
.br
.B task rc:<directory-path>/.taskrc

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B task
obtains its configuration data from a file called
.I .taskrc
\&. This file is normally located in the user's home directory:

.RS
$HOME/.taskrc
.RE

The default location can be overridden using the
.I rc:
attribute when running task:

.RS
$ task rc:<directory-path>/.taskrc
.RE

Individual option can be overridden by using the
.I rc.<name>: 
attribute when running task:

.RS
$ task rc.<name>:<value> ...
.RE

If
.B task
is run without an existing configuration file it will ask if it should create a default, sample
.I .taskrc
file in the user's home directory.

The task configuration file consists of a series of "assignments" in each line. The "assignments" have the syntax:

.RS
<name-of-configuration-variable>=<value-to-be-set>
.RE

where:
.RS
.TP
<name-of-configuration-variable>
is one of the variables described below

.TP
<value-to-be-set>
is the value the variable is to be set to.
.RE

and set a configuration variable to a certain value. The equal sign ("=") is used to separate the variable
name from the value to be set.

The hash mark, or pound sign ("#") is used as a "comment" character. It can be used to annotate the
configuration file. All text after the character to the end of the line is ignored.

.SH CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
Valid variable names and their default values are:

.SS FILES

.TP
.B data.location=$HOME/.task
This is a path to the directory containing all the task files. By default, it is set up to be ~/.task,
for example: /home/paul/.task

.TP
.B locking=on
Determines whether task uses file locking when accessing the pending.data and completed.data files.
Default to "on". Solaris users who store the task data files on an NFS mount may need to set locking
to "off". Note that setting this value to "off" is dangerous. It means that another program may write
to the task.pending file when task is attempting to do the same.

.SS TERMINAL
.TP
.B curses=on
Determines whether task uses ncurses to establish the size of the window you are
using, for text wrapping.

.TP
.B defaultwidth=80
The width of tables used when ncurses support is not available. Defaults to 80.

.TP
.B editor=vi
Specifies which text editor you wish to use for when the
.B task edit <ID>
command is used. Task will first look for this configuration variable. If found, it is used.
Otherwise task will look for the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables, before it defaults
to using "vi".

.SS MISCELLANEOUS

.TP
.B locale=en-US
The locale is a combination of ISO 639-1 language code and ISO 3166 country
code.  If not specified, task will assume en-US.  If specified, task will locate
the correct file of localized strings and proceed.  It is an error to specify a
locale for which there is no strings file.

.TP
.B confirmation=yes
May be "yes" or "no", and determines whether task will ask for confirmation before deleting a task or doing bulk changes.

.TP
.B echo.command=yes
May be "yes" or "no", and causes task to display the ID and description of any task when you run the start, stop, do, undo or delete commands. The default value is "yes". 

.TP
.B annotation.details=2
Controls the output of annotations in reports. Defaults to 2 - all annotations are displayed. Set to 1 only the last (youngest) annotation is displayed and if there are more than one present for a task a "+" sign is added to the description. Set to 0 the output of annotations is disabled and a "+" sign will be added if there are any annotations present.

.TP
.B next=2
Is a number, defaulting to 2, which is the number of tasks for each project that are shown in the 
.B task next
command.

.TP
.B bulk=2
Is a number, defaulting to 2.  When more than this number of tasks are modified in a single command, confirmation will be required, unless the
.B confirmation
variable is "no".

.TP
.B nag=You have higher priority tasks.
This may be a string of text, or blank. It is used as a prompt when a task is completed
that is not considered high priority. The "task next" command lists important tasks, and
completing one of those does not generate this nagging. Default value is: You have higher
priority tasks.

.TP
.B complete.all.projects=yes
May be yes or no, and determines whether the tab completion scripts consider all the
project names you have used, or just the ones used in active tasks.

.TP
.B complete.all.tags=yes
May be yes or no, and determines whether the tab completion scripts consider all the
tag names you have used, or just the ones used in active tasks.

.SS DATES

.TP
.B dateformat=m/d/Y
.TP
.B reportdateformat=m/d/Y
.TP
.B report.X.dateformat=m/d/Y
This is a string of characters that define how task formats dates. The precedence order
for the configuration variable is report.X.dateformat then reportdateformat then dateformat.
While report.X.dateformat only formats the due date in reports, does reportdateformat format
the due date both in reports and "task info". If both of these are not set then dateformat
will be applied to the due date. Input dates as well as all other dates in reports are formatted
according to dateformat.

The default value is: m/d/Y.  The string should contain the characters

.RS
m  minimal-digit month,   for example 1 or 12
.br
d  minimal-digit day,     for example 1 or 30
.br
y  two-digit year,        for example 09
.br
D  two-digit day,         for example 01 or 30
.br
M  two-digit month,       for example 01 or 12
.br
Y  four-digit year,       for example 2009
.br
a  short name of weekday, for example Mon or Wed
.br
A  long name of weekday,  for example Monday or Wednesday
.br
b  short name of month,   for example Jan or Aug
.br
B  long name of month,    for example January or August
.br
V  weeknumber,            for example 03 or 37
.RE

The string may also contain other characters to act as spacers, or formatting. Examples for other
values of dateformat:

.RS
.br
d/m/Y  would use for input and output 24/7/2009
.br
yMD    would use for input and output 090724
.br
M-D-Y  would use for input and output 07-24-2009
.RE

Examples for other values of reportdateformat:

.RS
.br
a D b Y (V)  would do an output as "Fri 24 Jul 2009 (30)"
.br
A, B D, Y    would do an output as "Friday, July 24, 2009"
.br
vV a Y-M-D   would do an output as "v30 Fri 2009-07.24"
.RE

.TP
.B weekstart=Sunday
Determines the day a week starts. Valid values are Sunday or Monday only.

.TP
.B displayweeknumber=yes
Determines if week numbers are displayed when using the "task calendar" command.
The week number is dependent on the day a week starts.

.TP
.B due=7
This is the number of days into the future that define when a task is considered due,
and is colored accordingly. Defaults to 7.

.TP calendar.details=no
If set to yes running "task calendar" will display the details of tasks with due dates
that fall into the calendar period.

.TP calendar.details.report=list
The report to run when displaying the details of tasks with due date when running the
"task calendar" command.

.TP
.B monthsperline=2
Determines how many months the "task calendar" command renders across the screen.
Defaults to however many will fit. If more months that will fit are specified,
task will only show as many that will fit.

.SS COLOR CONTROLS

.TP
.B color=on
May be "on" or "off". Determines whether task uses color. When "off", task will
use dashes (-----) to underline column headings.

.TP
.B fontunderline=on
Determines if font underlines or ASCII dashes should be used to underline
headers.

Task has a number of coloration rules. They correspond to a particular attribute
of a task, such as it being due, or being active, and specifies the automatic
coloring of that task. A list of valid color, depending on your terminal, can be

.I shadow.file
configuration variable. The format is identical to that of
.I default.command
\&. Please see the corresponding documentation for that command.

.TP
