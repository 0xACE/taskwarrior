Some considerable time ago - longer than I had hoped - I demonstrated an
alternate implementation of the todo script, called task, in the form of a
YouTube movie:

A lot has happened since then, and the task program has been slowly improving
thanks to feedback from some early testers, and continuous use by me.  Today,
I have uploaded a new movie:

This movie includes most of the changes and improvements to task, but behind
the scenes are the biggest changes.  There was a rewrite of the underlying
storage mechanism yielding a clean API for the front end, and the code was
reviewed for portability and converted to use GNU autoconf/automake.

Task has been released under GPL, and so far has been tested on:

  Max OS X 10.4 (Tiger)
  Max OS X 10.5 (Leopard)
  Fedora 8
  Fedora 9
  Ubuntu 8 (Hardy Heron)
  Solaris 10

Task has been making me more organized and productive for some time now.
Perhaps some of you might find it useful, and I welcome feedback of all kinds.

You can find the task source code at:

Thank you.
