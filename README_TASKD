Welcome To Taskwarrior 2.3.0 Alpha
----------------------------------

The alpha release of Taskwarrior 2.3.0 is for testing the Task Server.
Currently Taskwarrior is the only client for the Task Server.  There are several
unaddressed bugs in this release, so proper precautions with your data are
required.


Building Taskwarrior
--------------------

You will need the following depdendencies:

  cmake
  make
  g++/clang or equivalent
  libuuid
  libgnutls (devel copy, with certtools)
  libreadline


Configuring Taskwarrior as a Task Server Client
-----------------------------------------------

When a new user is added to the Task Server, a UUID key is generated, along with
an x.509 cert.  See Task Server operation document.  Before proceeding, you will
need the following items:

  <server:port>   Where Task Server is running (Default: localhost:6544)
  <org>           Name of organization (default: Public)
  <user>          User name added to server
  <key>           Key UUID generated by server
  <cert>          Full path to client.cert.pem generated by server

Set these configuration variables in your Taskwarrior configuration,
substituting from above:

  task config taskd.server <server:port>
  task config taskd.credentials <org>/<user>/<key>
  task config taskd.certificate <cert>

Here is an example:

  task config taskd.server localhost:6544
  task config taskd.credentials 'Public/John Doe/8ad2e3db-914d-4832-b0e6-72fa04f6e331'
  task config taskd.certificate ~/.task/client.cert.pem
