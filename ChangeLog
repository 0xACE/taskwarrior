------ current release ---------------------------

1.6.0 (?)
  + Added support for new "append" command that adds more description text to
    an existing task.

------ old releases ------------------------------

1.5.0 (3/15/2009)
  + Removed deprecated TUTORIAL file.
  + Removed "showage" configuration variable.
  + "task stop" can now remove the start time from a started task.
  + "task ghistory" now displays a differently aligned graph, allowing
    easier comparison by month of tasks added versus completed and deleted.
  + "task version" command now reports unrecognized configuration variables,
    which may be spelling mistakes or deprecated variables.
  + "configure --enable-debug" now supported to suppress compiler optimization
    to allow debugging.
  + Allow lower case priorities, and automatically upper case them.
  + Added support for "due" configuration variable which defines the number
    of days in the future when a task is considered due.
  + Added support for custom reports, comprised of a set of column names and
    sort order, with optional filtering in the configuration file.  This
    means user-defined reports can be written, and the reports currently
    in the configuration file can be renamed.  Several of task's built in
    reports have been converted to user-defined reports.
  + New online documentation for custom reports.
  + New algorithm for determining when the "nag" message is displayed.
  + Fixed bug where task hangs with a certain combination of recurring tasks
    and shadow files.
  + Fixed bug with the task sort algorithm, which led to an unstable sequence
    when there were only a handful of tasks.
  + Performance enhanced by eliminating unnecessary sorting.
  + Task now has a large (and growing) test suite and bug regression tests
    to help ensure higher quality releases.
  + Fixed bug that caused performance hit during table rendering.
  + Fixed bug that concatenated a modified description without spaces.
  + Added new column 'recur' that displays the recurrence period of any
    recurring tasks.  This column can be added to any custom report.
  + Added support for "color.recurring" configuration variable which
    specifies the color of recurring tasks.
  + Added support for "locking" configuration variable that controls whether
    file locking is used.
  + Task export feature now includes recurrence information, removes nested
    quotes, and limits output to pending tasks.
  + Task no longer includes deleted tasks in the summary report (thanks to
    Benjamin Tegarden).
  + Fixed bug that prevented the summary report from properly reporting
    recently completed tasks.

1.4.3 (11/1/2008) 8639e9260646c8c9224e0fc47e5d2443b46eecfc
  + Fixed misleading task count at bottom on "info" report.
  + Added support for a shadow file that contains a plain text task report,
    with the "shadow.file" and "shadow.command" configuration variables
    The shadow file is automatically updated whenever the task database
    changes.  Useful for integrating with "Samurize"
  + Task now displays a message whenever a shadow file is updated, if the
    "shadow.notify" configuration variable is set "on"
  + Bug: adding a task with a \n, \r or \f in it now fails properly
  + Removed "usage" command, and support for "command.logging" configuration
    variable.
  + Added documentation for Shadow files.
  + Added documentation for task filters.

1.4.2 (9/18/2008) e7304e86ce9bb80978c7055fd2a9e999619a6fb8
  + "task undo" can now retract a "task done" command, provided no reports
    have been run (and therefore TDB::gc run)
  + Task now correctly sorts on entire strings, instead of just the first
    character (thanks to Andy Lester)
  + Task now uses dashes (-----) to column underlines when color is disabled
    (thanks to Vincent Fleuranceau)
  + Task now allows mixed case attribute names (pri:, PRI:, Pri: ...) and
    commands (add, ADD, Add ...) (thanks to Vincent Fleuranceau)
  + Task now supports a default project and priority for new tasks, via
    the new "default.project" and "default.priority" configuration variables
    (thanks to Vincent Fleuranceau)
  + Task supports improved word-wrapping to the terminal width
  + Task now supports "default.command" configuration variable (for example
    it could contain "list due:tomorrow") that is the command that is run
    whenever task is invoked with no arguments.
  + Task supports modifying the existing description of a task, with the
    following syntax: task <id> "new description ...".
  + Bug: Now properly supports relative dates in filters (task list due:eom,
    task list due:tomorrow, task list due:23rd ...)
  + Bug: Source now properly includes <string.h> in order to build clean
    using gcc 4.3 (thanks to H. İbrahim Güngör)
